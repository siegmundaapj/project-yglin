Pain Painter
This card's name becomes "Plaguespreader Zombie" while on the field. Once per turn: You can target up to 2 Zombie monsters you control, except this card; they become Level 2 (until the end of this turn), and if they do, they cannot be used as Synchro Material, except for the Synchro Summon of a Zombie monster.
