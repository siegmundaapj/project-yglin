Dragunity Pilum
When this card is Normal Summoned: You can Special Summon 1 Winged Beast "Dragunity" monster from your hand, then equip it with this card. While this card is equipped to a monster, that monster can attack your opponent directly, but when it does so using this effect, the battle damage inflicted to your opponent is halved.
