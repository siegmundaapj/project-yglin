2 monsters including a "Gladiator Beast" monster
If this card is Link Summoned: You can add 1 "Gladiator Beast" card from your Deck to your hand. You can target 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster you control; shuffle that "Gladiator Beast" monster into the Deck, and if you do, Special Summon 1 "Gladiator Beast" monster with a different original name from your Deck. (This is treated as a Special Summon by a "Gladiator Beast" monster's effect.) You can only use each effect of "Test Panther" once per turn.
