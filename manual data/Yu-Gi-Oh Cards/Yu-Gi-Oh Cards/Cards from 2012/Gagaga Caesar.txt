Gagaga Caesar
Cannot attack unless you control another face-up "Gagaga" monster. Once per turn: You can banish 1 monster from your Graveyard that has a Level; the Levels of all face-up "Gagaga" monsters you currently control become the Level of that monster. This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster.
