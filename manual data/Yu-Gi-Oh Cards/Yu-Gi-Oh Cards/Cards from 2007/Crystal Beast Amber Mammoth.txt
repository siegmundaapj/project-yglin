Crystal Beast Amber Mammoth
When another "Crystal Beast" monster you control is targeted for an attack: You can change the attack target to this card. If this face-up card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.
