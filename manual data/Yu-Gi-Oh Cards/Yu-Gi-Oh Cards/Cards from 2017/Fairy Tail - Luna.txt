Fairy Tail - Luna
When this card is Normal Summoned: You can add 1 Spellcaster monster with 1850 ATK from your Deck to your hand. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; your opponent can send 1 card with that monster's name from their Deck or Extra Deck to the GY to negate this effect, otherwise return both this card and that monster to the hand.
