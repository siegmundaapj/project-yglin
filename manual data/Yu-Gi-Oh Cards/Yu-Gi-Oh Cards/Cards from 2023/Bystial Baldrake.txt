Bystial Baldrake
You can target 1 LIGHT or DARK monster in either GY; banish it, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand. This is a Quick Effect if your opponent controls a monster. If your opponent Special Summons a Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monster(s) (except during the Damage Step): You can Tribute 1 other LIGHT or DARK monster, then target 1 of those Special Summoned monsters; banish it. You can only use each effect of "Bystial Baldrake" once per turn.
