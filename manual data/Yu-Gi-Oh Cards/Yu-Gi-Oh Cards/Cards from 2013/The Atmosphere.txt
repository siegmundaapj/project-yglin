The Atmosphere
Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must first be Special Summoned (from your hand) by banishing 2 monsters you control and 1 monster from your Graveyard. Once per turn: You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; equip that target to this card. (You can only equip 1 monster at a time to this card with this effect.) This card gains ATK and DEF equal to the ATK and DEF of that equipped monster.
