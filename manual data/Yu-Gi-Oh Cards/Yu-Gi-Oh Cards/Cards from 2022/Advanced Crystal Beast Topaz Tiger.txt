Advanced Crystal Beast Topaz Tiger
If "Advanced Dark" is not in a Field Zone, send this monster to the GY. All "Advanced Crystal Beast" monsters you control gain 400 ATK/DEF, also monsters your opponent controls lose 400 ATK/DEF. If this face-up card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.
