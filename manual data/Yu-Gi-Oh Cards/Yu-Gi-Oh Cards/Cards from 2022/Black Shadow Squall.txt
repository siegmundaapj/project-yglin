Black Shadow Squall
When a Spell/Trap Card is activated: Remove 1 Black Feather Counter from your field; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card. If you control "Black-Winged Dragon": You can Set this card from your GY, but banish it when it leaves the field. You can only use 1 "Black Shadow Squall" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
