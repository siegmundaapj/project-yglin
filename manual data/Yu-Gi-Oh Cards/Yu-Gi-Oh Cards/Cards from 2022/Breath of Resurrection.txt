Breath of Resurrection
If you control an "Adventurer Token": Special Summon up to 2 monsters from your hand and/or GY with different names (but banish them when they leave the field), then you can equip 1 Equip Spell that mentions "Adventurer Token" from your hand or GY to 1 monster you control. You can only activate 1 "Breath of Resurrection" per turn.
