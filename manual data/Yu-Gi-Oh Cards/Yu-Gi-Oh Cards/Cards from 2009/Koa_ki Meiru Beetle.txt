Koa'ki Meiru Beetle
During each of your End Phases, destroy this card unless you send 1 "Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru" from your hand to the Graveyard or reveal 1 Insect-Type monster in your hand. If a LIGHT or DARK monster is Special Summoned in Attack Position: Change that monster to Defense Position.
