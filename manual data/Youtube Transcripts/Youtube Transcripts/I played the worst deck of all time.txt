# https://www.youtube.com/watch/bu0liVbleUM

00:00:02.320 this is not a brick I can't believe I
00:00:05.879 get to say that but this is not a brick
00:00:07.720 I have no idea how this deck plays oh
00:00:09.760 you'll
00:00:10.519 see oh my God not a bot wow so what they
00:00:15.240 don't know is my deck doesn't do
00:00:18.119 anything no peeps I think they know no
00:00:20.400 no no they didn't know they didn't see a
00:00:22.080 card on board oh Ash yeah sure yeah sure
00:00:25.439 that's that's that's that's true and
00:00:26.800 real like yeah you go ahead these cards
00:00:29.480 do nothing see that's actually the win
00:00:31.800 condition of this deck yeah they've just
00:00:33.320 minus twed themselves like what what
00:00:35.600 okay like sure good job imperm pass
00:00:38.879 excuse me hello imperm pass is that your
00:00:42.559 win Condition it's the only good card in
00:00:44.160 the deck you know what while my opponent
00:00:46.480 is going nuts I'm going to explain why
00:00:48.559 this deck is bad so first and foremost
00:00:49.879 let's talk about the field spell the
00:00:50.920 field spell does nothing the field spell
00:00:52.840 does not do anything on its own it is
00:00:56.079 only good it it was only engine if
00:00:59.239 you're going second and your opponent
00:01:01.359 has three face up cards face up cards
00:01:05.239 face up cards okay remember have the
00:01:07.720 point of this deck the main disruption
00:01:09.200 of this deck is to set cards face down
00:01:11.439 right demigod it's actually a genuinely
00:01:14.240 good card it set cards face down like
00:01:15.960 Karma Cannon however it sets face down
00:01:18.360 the field spell in order to get its
00:01:20.200 beneficial effect to summon God from
00:01:21.759 hander deck requires face up cards like
00:01:25.640 baffling design choice right there why
00:01:28.360 why why does this require face up cards
00:01:29.799 why three more face up cards are you
00:01:31.320 [ __ ] stupid are you an idiot good
00:01:33.240 okay good I drew the only good card in
00:01:34.560 my deck thank God okay as I draw more
00:01:36.920 Tina cards I'm going to talk about why
00:01:38.759 they're bad all right breath okay so
00:01:41.479 breath of the testina this is one of the
00:01:43.079 cards that pisses me off more than
00:01:44.640 anything else okay breast breast what
00:01:47.640 breath is a consistency tool it is a
00:01:50.079 card that searches for Tusa cards but it
00:01:52.360 doesn't search for Tina cards just on
00:01:54.360 activation like a normal [ __ ] card
00:01:56.479 would you have to put a card face down
00:01:59.399 in order to do it so in order to get a
00:02:01.759 card to search you have to summon a
00:02:03.920 thing like sometimes you just have to
00:02:05.759 summon a hand trap in order to search
00:02:07.240 for a card right why doesn't it just on
00:02:09.399 activation search for a to Seena card
00:02:11.319 why did they overbalance a consistency
00:02:13.239 tool it makes no [ __ ] sense to me
00:02:14.959 like I just it just it fundamentally
00:02:16.840 just is it it's nothing it's nothing it
00:02:18.720 doesn't doesn't do anything so you have
00:02:20.640 to you have to waste a hand trap or
00:02:23.440 waste an engine
00:02:25.239 piece what cuz they want you to go
00:02:27.400 second no they don't no they don't they
00:02:30.000 don't want you to go second because
00:02:31.720 they're the whole like the best card in
00:02:33.599 the deck is during your opponent's turn
00:02:35.879 it's an interaction they do not want you
00:02:37.920 to go second okay Crystal God this is
00:02:40.120 another funny one uh Crystal God sucks
00:02:43.040 it's a brick it's your boss monster
00:02:44.640 that's also a brick very funny why does
00:02:46.800 it return to hand in end phase I don't
00:02:48.519 [ __ ] know why does play return Your
00:02:50.599 Monster to hand in the end phase they
00:02:52.120 gave you a tool that actually gets your
00:02:53.640 boss monster on the board but then gave
00:02:55.280 it a downside I I just I don't [ __ ]
00:02:58.840 understand
00:03:03.040 oh okay so like there's just so many
00:03:06.799 things that don't like Mak sense it's
00:03:09.280 just unbelievable okay we beat a
00:03:11.239 coughing baby and we ranked up yeah this
00:03:12.920 deck is crazy anytime we talk about this
00:03:14.760 deck the more I'm convinced it's it's
00:03:16.440 it's made by AI so my theory is that
00:03:19.480 they literally used AI to make this deck
00:03:23.200 there's no possible way you designed
00:03:26.000 this deck so piss ass bad without just
00:03:29.280 letting AI generate the effects it it
00:03:31.599 doesn't make sense like how do you have
00:03:35.640 so many a wealth of archetype knowledge
00:03:39.519 and you just go oh no the Searcher needs
00:03:43.080 to actually be a brick that's the other
00:03:45.200 thing with Breath by the way breath is a
00:03:47.760 hard once per turn so like like this
00:03:50.480 this is literally a brick this sand does
00:03:51.720 nothing it does nothing this is
00:03:53.400 literally pass pass the sand doesn't do
00:03:57.000 anything demigod is not a one card
00:03:59.120 starter there is no one card starter in
00:04:01.040 this deck every single piece in the deck
00:04:03.400 requires another thing to work most of
00:04:06.159 the combos are actually three card
00:04:07.959 combos in order to set up anything if
00:04:09.840 this gets ashed I lose okay resolv we're
00:04:12.400 good Max toena is a crazy card that's
00:04:14.439 true that's true max totina is
00:04:17.519 nuts there is there is one benefit to
00:04:20.759 this deck there is one benefit to this
00:04:22.680 deck and that is the engine is small you
00:04:27.880 have a lot of room for non-engine is it
00:04:30.039 even possible for the eventual ocg
00:04:31.800 Band-Aid to support to fix this yes yes
00:04:34.960 yes while this deck is ass there are
00:04:38.600 things you could make that would
00:04:40.479 genuinely fix it if if they made a card
00:04:42.880 that said you can a normal spell that
00:04:44.280 says uh you can or or add one Tina
00:04:47.039 monster from your deck to your hand if
00:04:49.160 this set card is destroyed by a card
00:04:51.840 Effect add one Tina card from your deck
00:04:54.600 to your hand then special summon one
00:04:57.080 Crystal God testina from your hand deck
00:04:59.759 graveyard or banishment if they made
00:05:02.280 that it would be
00:05:04.520 good LOL okay sure it should be a
00:05:07.600 continuous so you can use demigod to
00:05:08.880 summon itself actually yes that's a
00:05:10.520 really good point yes it should see you
00:05:12.199 know how the field spell requires face
00:05:13.520 up cards [ __ ] why it why why
00:05:16.000 everything in the desk puts their face
00:05:17.639 down like like it just it's so [ __ ]
00:05:21.080 maddening oh my God I'm going insane how
00:05:23.520 did you go 31 at locals with this I went
00:05:25.080 3-1 at locals with this three times
00:05:27.280 isn't that crazy my opponent just
00:05:29.000 doesn't know what my car do and that's
00:05:30.319 fine they they shouldn't know what my
00:05:31.520 cards do you're just cracked I am just
00:05:33.280 good at the game I am just good at the
00:05:34.560 game with bad decks that's just that's
00:05:35.960 just True by the way this is why this
00:05:37.840 deck needs tainted the deck needs
00:05:39.639 tainted if if I didn't have tainted I
00:05:41.639 couldn't win the game there wait did I I
00:05:43.319 didn't use the effect did I oh I did
00:05:45.560 okay we're good I'm like so mad that I'm
00:05:48.520 just
00:05:49.360 like this deck is ass it's so bad 20
00:05:53.319 true true this is the best deck ever
00:05:55.400 right oh my God I drew a combo are you
00:05:58.039 ready chat for a single combo
00:06:00.680 what does this deck do going first well
00:06:02.080 you're going to find out breath gives
00:06:03.280 you an extra normal because then you can
00:06:04.600 tribute Crystal God but you can't but
00:06:06.319 you can't there's no line to get enough
00:06:08.440 stuff on the board to Tribute Crystal
00:06:10.039 God oh that was a field spell
00:06:13.880 [ __ ] I literally just drew the wrong
00:06:16.759 card that was supposed to be breath God
00:06:19.240 damn it oh well I mean it still sets up
00:06:21.000 it still sets up the [ __ ] thing what
00:06:22.840 if Demi got of the testina was called
00:06:24.680 Freaky god of the testina and sucked
00:06:27.039 toes and gave head shut the [ __ ] off
00:06:31.000 this stream sucks man yeah I
00:06:33.599 know I wanted that off my screen I know
00:06:37.199 why does sentinel destroy when there's
00:06:38.440 no payoff for destroying that is the
00:06:40.479 most [ __ ] unbelievable thing of this
00:06:44.199 deck that is the most unbelievable thing
00:06:47.000 in this deck is that Sentinel has to
00:06:49.280 destroy a card when there's nothing that
00:06:51.960 benefits off of that stop asking why we
00:06:54.199 know why because an AI generated this
00:06:56.400 deck I'm 100% serious I'm 100% [ __ ]
00:06:58.520 serious oh come on
00:07:00.280 what thank
00:07:07.440 you
00:07:15.639 huh okay sure I just can't believe I got
00:07:18.680 battle faded definitely this Rank 10 is
00:07:20.720 indestructible oh no no chat if the rank
00:07:23.120 10 is destroyed you can summon a testina
00:07:26.319 from your grave now now ain't that ain't
00:07:28.919 that crazy e right chat what does the
00:07:31.199 Trap do if they activate a monster
00:07:33.120 effect I can book that monster and then
00:07:34.960 during the end phase um I can steal a
00:07:37.479 face down monster oh discordance that's
00:07:40.360 another [ __ ] thing discordance why
00:07:43.240 does discordance banish cards like
00:07:46.240 what's the point of that genuinely why
00:07:49.159 does this deck have a trap that banishes
00:07:51.159 cards there's nothing in the deck that
00:07:53.520 does
00:07:55.360 that
00:07:58.440 what
00:08:01.919 notice how the only dark testina is dog
00:08:04.039 [ __ ] you're not going to believe this I
00:08:06.120 disagree I actually think tainted is
00:08:08.280 like the only thing that gives this deck
00:08:09.919 a genuine win condition why do you like
00:08:11.840 totina so much you you think I like this
00:08:15.400 deck no no you have a vast
00:08:17.800 misunderstanding of what's Happening
00:08:19.319 Here the Art's great the art is great I
00:08:21.360 think you could genuinely fix this deck
00:08:23.039 with like two cards a light totina Link
00:08:25.759 monster and a uh an a spell that's an
00:08:28.919 actual Searcher I think does fix this I
00:08:31.680 genuinely I I I really do I really do I
00:08:34.080 banished Leba didn't I like a [ __ ]
00:08:36.519 idiot I banish Gustav why did I banish
00:08:39.080 Gustav and not Leba I'm [ __ ] stupid
00:08:41.440 damn if only I played a
00:08:44.000 second deity cuz I just lose to Nibiru
00:08:47.920 here unfortunately yeah okay
00:08:52.000 good three unbelievably I'm 3
00:08:56.760 0 honestly that's fine no no no no no no
00:09:00.079 you see um Sentinel is a bad card
00:09:03.160 because I have to pop another [ __ ]
00:09:04.880 card so if I look chat right here if I
00:09:07.440 normal Sentinel pop itself search
00:09:10.040 demigod I can't play you know how
00:09:12.240 [ __ ] stupid that is because the only
00:09:15.000 way it was you know I would have to set
00:09:16.480 my [ __ ] triple Tack and pop it I'm
00:09:19.839 not doing that I'm hand ripping I'm hand
00:09:22.600 ripping something that beats the
00:09:25.399 max sure sure you know what a is dog
00:09:32.640 yeah get so [ __ ]
00:09:36.440 owned so
00:09:38.519 chat what do I do here it's literally
00:09:41.680 it's literally pop it self search
00:09:44.560 play the reason why is because the only
00:09:48.120 way to make sure that I'm online next
00:09:51.959 turn is to set
00:09:54.519 play do I even set this if I set this
00:09:58.880 and it gets popped I literally lose I
00:10:01.800 have to I have to keep it in hand they
00:10:03.120 have nothing to pop it with but there's
00:10:04.880 no reason to set it either I guess like
00:10:06.399 it would prevent damage I probably
00:10:08.360 should have said it in retrospect I
00:10:09.680 should have said it I know the hand it's
00:10:10.839 drewis worm some other [ __ ] card I
00:10:12.360 didn't read and yeah okay all right
00:10:14.640 we're
00:10:15.399 good okay okay how does this deck like
00:10:18.279 Bal gcd I'm so glad you asked okay so
00:10:23.600 you know how the boss monster is a brick
00:10:26.040 you know how the boss monster is a brick
00:10:27.920 you can't draw it because it does
00:10:29.959 nothing the field spell doesn't work
00:10:32.160 with it if you draw it um like it's it's
00:10:35.440 also a light they made the boss monster
00:10:38.839 a [ __ ] light monster so it was
00:10:42.600 released in the height of bisel format
00:10:45.560 Dragon link bisti was one of the best
00:10:48.000 decks when this came out and you know
00:10:49.320 what they gave the boss monsters
00:10:50.760 attribute a [ __ ] light they made it
00:10:53.480 all right and you know what the reborn
00:10:55.680 card the quick play spell that Reborns
00:10:58.040 it to stina which ised to be the thing
00:11:00.200 that fixed the ability to play totina
00:11:02.920 they literally didn't let it summon from
00:11:04.880 summon from banishment so if your
00:11:06.600 Crystal God gets banished your F the
00:11:08.760 game's over you literally just lose oh
00:11:12.240 I'm going [ __ ] insane dude this deck
00:11:14.959 is so [ __ ] bad I didn't play around
00:11:17.560 the [ __ ] drw worm because the whole
00:11:18.920 deck is lights and darks oh oh by the
00:11:21.000 way the drwi worm it sends this card it
00:11:24.480 sends it well but this oh it's just
00:11:26.480 destroyed it brings itself back oh the
00:11:28.680 biggest [ __ ] boss monster where you
00:11:30.680 have to invest all of your [ __ ]
00:11:32.040 engine in order to play it oh it it if
00:11:34.200 it's destroyed it floats just genuinely
00:11:36.959 [ __ ] morons dude just idiots idiots
00:11:39.959 [ __ ] dumb asses that made this
00:11:41.760 [ __ ] Deck Gold pride is good I think
00:11:43.720 they did a good job with gold Pride I
00:11:45.399 even think flame swordsman's good I like
00:11:46.800 The Flame Swordsman cards I think the
00:11:47.920 Flame Swordsman cards have a game plan
00:11:49.880 and are good cards okay now I got to out
00:11:52.240 this [ __ ] drw worm all right um we're
00:11:55.160 going to get
00:11:58.240 breath
00:12:05.600 I'm being mean I actually I don't think
00:12:07.800 the TCG archetype designers are bad at
00:12:09.440 their job I do think that there is a
00:12:11.920 conspiracy that the TCG archetypes are
00:12:14.199 bad for a reason I don't know what it is
00:12:17.360 I don't know what it is I don't know
00:12:20.120 what it is but I genuinely believe that
00:12:22.880 there is something holding them back
00:12:24.600 from making decks good and it is really
00:12:28.680 frustrating
00:12:30.320 it's really frustrating at this point
00:12:32.760 because they can make archetypes good
00:12:36.399 they can do it it would be fine you can
00:12:38.360 make good decks please please like
00:12:40.519 literally please I'm begging you make a

00:27:37.159 OHA game play I
00:27:40.720 literally I can't [ __ ] believe this
00:27:45.360 this deck is so ass mode I cannot
00:27:49.039 believe I literally like legitimately
00:27:51.559 cannot believe that I have gotten this
00:27:54.840 far with this deck you are the deity
00:27:56.640 that defies I am the deity that defies
00:27:59.360 Darkness I am here's my issue with
00:28:02.200 Nibiru okay I'm going to talk a little
00:28:04.080 bit about Tina deck building Theory
00:28:07.480 since I am officially the the person the
00:28:12.399 person who is the the the uh the
00:28:15.880 authority on titina deck
00:28:18.279 building all right so let me explain why
00:28:21.399 I'm only playing one
00:28:23.000 Nibiru the reason why Nibiru is at one
00:28:26.799 is because mainly it's because of the
00:28:28.440 thing you draw off of Maxi right it's
00:28:30.440 it's just there to draw off of Maxi
00:28:32.039 right the reason you want low impact non
00:28:37.200 once per turn hand traps is because it
00:28:40.039 is the only way like if your opponent
00:28:42.399 makes a half board that is the only way
00:28:45.360 that you're reliably going to make this
00:28:47.559 second effect live like that's it I
00:28:51.559 don't want to neiru my opponent because
00:28:53.640 if I neiru my opponent and wipe their
00:28:56.279 field they have one monster face up
00:29:00.240 right so that lessens the chance that my
00:29:03.840 [ __ ] domain is going to be
00:29:07.039 live so you want to like Veil or imperm
00:29:10.200 Ash that kind of stuff nir was here just
00:29:12.679 to draw into but it God they made this
00:29:17.360 deck so bad and yet here I am also nibir
00:29:20.919 doesn't tribute face down that is that
00:29:23.679 it's [ __ ] true
