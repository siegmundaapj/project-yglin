00:00:10.759 here trying to hit that for end of the
00:00:11.920 year we only have 4,000 left to go we
00:00:13.880 are halfway through it um so let me know
00:00:16.400 in the comment section what else you
00:00:17.240 guys want to be seeing we are going to
00:00:18.199 be seeing Unchained to go first here is
00:00:20.400 going to be Unchained with the four
00:00:21.960 ubell cards that I was playing the three
00:00:23.880 nightmare Thrones alongside that grave
00:00:25.279 scrimer we're going to be normal Su with
00:00:26.960 a copy of ARA activ in the effect of
00:00:28.840 shawarma or I guess shavara in the hand
00:00:30.800 I know some people are upset that I keep
00:00:32.119 calling it Shawarma and then we're going
00:00:34.360 to be popping the Raa here Raa is going
00:00:36.120 to activate effect summoning a copy of
00:00:37.680 shyama from the deck uh and we now can
00:00:42.360 go into a copy of Yama which is going to
00:00:44.559 be able to trigger out the copy of
00:00:46.360 shavara as well as the Yama and we also
00:00:48.960 have the I guess the shavara whatever
00:00:52.120 it's called I don't even care anymore
00:00:53.960 the Red Dog and we also have the blue
00:00:56.039 dog now on the graveyard to be able to
00:00:57.120 pop that copy of the Trap that we want
00:00:58.440 to as well and we are going to be adding
00:00:59.719 the copy of uh arua to the hand
00:01:06.439 here a little bit of a weird unchain
00:01:09.040 lines because we are um we are user
00:01:12.920 normal summon so we can't even search
00:01:14.040 for the Sama we're are going to go into
00:01:16.759 the squirmer here with the Yama
00:01:18.960 alongside the copy of itself special out
00:01:21.240 cuz you control a fiend and then we are
00:01:22.720 going to be add the effect of shyama
00:01:24.119 destroying the copy of the Escape here
00:01:26.720 bringing itself out yama's going to
00:01:28.159 activate effects bringing out the copy
00:01:29.520 of the Red Dog and we're bring up the
00:01:30.920 copy of here of the sarama uh we can now
00:01:34.320 overlay for a copy of the Caesar and we
00:01:37.439 can go for the effect uh we should have
00:01:40.240 set the other one here um The
00:01:44.119 Escape Army just setting the copy of or
00:01:46.719 we should have set the chamber here so
00:01:48.240 we could have popped to add back with
00:01:50.439 rage um but we're going to be just going
00:01:52.439 to activate the effect of saram in the
00:01:54.280 copy of Escape blowing itself up and
00:01:56.439 then uh we don't get the effect so we're
00:01:58.759 going to be seeing the Aras activ
00:02:00.280 effects here and we are going to be
00:02:01.360 thinking about it we say this you have
00:02:03.320 to declare which effect you're going to
00:02:04.360 be using because if we if they don't
00:02:06.159 have to declare we can chain the copy of
00:02:08.038 Caesar essentially stop the Trap um set
00:02:12.400 but I believe it does
00:02:16.000 not so then they're going to activate
00:02:18.000 the effect of darum or they're going to
00:02:19.599 set the Dum again which can be activated
00:02:21.080 this turn which is going to kindly screw
00:02:23.879 us up here you know setting that copy of
00:02:26.400 Caesar
00:02:36.879 we're going to be destroying the rage
00:02:39.800 alongside the copy of the Caesar here
00:02:42.200 this is that like the dumican sends the
00:02:46.200 copy of Rage then we're not going to be
00:02:47.519 able to activate effects to add back um
00:02:49.760 but by doing it like this we are going
00:02:51.920 to be wasting our Escape here but we're
00:02:54.159 not going to be able to use it anyway so
00:02:55.599 this is going to let us add back with
00:02:56.879 the rage alongside being able to set
00:02:58.920 with the red um as well which is pretty
00:03:01.080 nice Nam the copy of chamber
00:03:03.319 unfortunately you know we should have
00:03:05.120 just set that one in the first place
00:03:06.480 there to be able to add back those
00:03:07.640 carots but it would have kind of
00:03:09.920 prevented us from getting hit with that
00:03:11.120 DaRuMa Cannon there but it is what it
00:03:16.680 is they're getting a normal summon out a
00:03:19.000 copy of Ariana we do hit that with a
00:03:21.159 copy of bayor they will be able to
00:03:22.400 summon back out the copy of the ARA
00:03:25.360 which can then Synchro or link up into a
00:03:27.720 chaos angel or a Yama here going for
00:03:29.360 that chaos angel banishing that copy of
00:03:31.519 the chamber we do hit that with an
00:03:33.040 imperm there making sure that we do not
00:03:35.239 lose that chamber which is what we need
00:03:37.000 they're going to go battlef face attack
00:03:38.200 with that copy of chaos Angel making us
00:03:40.159 take the 35 and just pass turn on this
00:03:42.920 or I guess set one and then activate the
00:03:44.680 effect of change drag aier send in the
00:03:46.480 copy of skill drain to then set a big
00:03:50.319 welcome and passing turn on that
00:04:00.120 we're going to draw here and we have
00:04:01.799 lots of options we can start off with a
00:04:03.239 chamber we also have the shyama which
00:04:05.760 can be storing itself but we have the
00:04:07.439 SAR in the hand as well here to normal
00:04:09.680 summon itself
00:04:10.959 out and they do flip a big welcome to
00:04:20.000 this suing with the lovely bouncing the
00:04:22.880 copy of chaos Angel to the extra deck
00:04:24.880 once again
00:04:32.400 and then lovely's going to try to
00:04:33.479 activate here alongside the copy of
00:04:35.160 Shand draer and we think do we chain
00:04:37.120 they're going to pop from our hand and
00:04:38.960 they destroy a copy of arua
00:04:40.560 unfortunately does not trigger in the
00:04:41.880 hand that would be crazy if you could
00:04:43.400 pop them from the hand and they trigger
00:04:45.320 um but they do not
00:04:49.160 here we do have a few options that we
00:04:51.520 can use we can go for srama set the copy
00:04:53.919 of arua destroying itself and then we
00:04:56.039 can actually search or summon it from
00:04:57.880 the deck most likely summon it a copy of
00:05:00.120 the disaster dog or a copy of the
00:05:02.880 Abomination here actually effect sending
00:05:05.000 the copy of the veiler to hit that back
00:05:08.000 row they're going to chain the copy of
00:05:09.800 trap tricks
00:05:11.199 here you know the Abomination does not
00:05:14.440 actually Target therefore um it's kind
00:05:16.400 of useful they're going to set the copy
00:05:18.280 of DaRuMa Canon and then they're going
00:05:20.680 to most likely flip up the DaRuMa Canon
00:05:23.400 here if we do not choose to destroy it
00:05:36.000 I'm not wrong right the Abomination
00:05:37.479 doesn't trigger doesn't tet does it I
00:05:40.800 could be mistaken would not be the first
00:05:44.160 time I thought it didn't trigger but or
00:05:47.240 doesn't doesn't Target that could be the
00:05:50.000 other one the link that doesn't Target
00:05:51.960 at
00:05:54.759 all yeah it does not Target there so
00:05:57.039 they wouldn't be able to flip that uh
00:05:59.080 trap trick face up we definitely uh
00:06:02.360 definitely should have realized that I
00:06:03.759 was pretty sure it didn't
00:06:10.400 Target we go into a copy of the Yama
00:06:13.440 here
00:06:18.720 um and then we're going to go shyama on
00:06:21.000 the face down and we're going to be
00:06:22.759 chaining the effect of chamber here they
00:06:24.840 go can you do that to sell someone with
00:06:26.080 the copy of shyama we go yeah it just we
00:06:28.199 won't be able to uh summon from the deck
00:06:30.880 with the copy of chamber but chamber is
00:06:32.759 going to be summon with the copy of the
00:06:34.199 Sama
00:06:37.360 here yeah definitely a misplay on our
00:06:39.960 parts it does not Target I was pretty
00:06:42.400 sure it didn't I don't know why I was
00:06:44.520 not realizing that in the game we're
00:06:46.080 going to link up into the copy of
00:06:47.319 Anguish we're going to see shyama being
00:06:48.639 put to the bottom of the deck here and
00:06:50.000 they're kind of forced to flip up that
00:06:52.319 copy of the here and we have
00:06:55.680 the chain for this
00:06:59.639 we have to activate the effect
00:07:02.080 of Yama
00:07:04.759 alongside the
00:07:12.599 uh Yama we have yeah we have Yama here
00:07:16.520 and we also have the
00:07:19.479 Sama sum out the anguish and then we
00:07:22.120 also summon out a copy
00:07:24.639 of I'm disaster dog has to be face up
00:07:28.400 monsters yeah
00:07:34.080 we're counting our in chain cars in the
00:07:35.560 graveyard so probably the disaster dog
00:07:38.000 we could go
00:07:40.919 for shyama again if we wanted to which
00:07:44.360 we are going to be choosing to do here
00:07:49.360 okay there go battle phase attack
00:07:55.560 attack and leaving them just with the
00:07:58.000 the star in the hand we should have
00:08:00.560 we should have won there if we would
00:08:01.879 have paid attention to the effects of
00:08:04.120 our cards
00:08:07.440 but oh well we're trying to think if we
00:08:09.639 should go for an SP line as
00:08:13.720 well CU we have not use arua
00:08:18.800 nor the um the Raa
00:08:22.879 but we're going to be seeing the shyama
00:08:25.440 pop the Red Dog here which can then set
00:08:28.319 they copy of Chambers we can actually
00:08:29.599 bring back out the copy of rage and
00:08:31.400 we're going to go up into a copy of
00:08:34.320 SP now unfortunately for us rage is not
00:08:37.000 going to be that great other than going
00:08:38.880 for another copy of Yama because we
00:08:40.640 already are going through the SP and we
00:08:41.799 don't play unicorn in this we're going
00:08:43.039 to banish to lovely which already makes
00:08:44.519 it so very kind of hard for them to
00:08:45.720 continue their plays I guess their kind
00:08:48.000 of a bigger plays they will still have
00:08:49.760 the lovely being able to reset a bunch
00:08:51.000 of cards and stuff like that they're
00:08:51.959 going to be just setting one card here
00:08:53.040 and then normal someone with a copy of
00:08:54.320 Shand Drager they can go for a copy here
00:08:57.600 of the Typhon but if they try to go for
00:08:59.760 Typhon we just flip up the copy of
00:09:01.160 chamber go for that rage Su up the copy
00:09:03.600 of then on the summon we just go rage
00:09:06.200 here use the Typhon as
00:09:12.920 well and then we just rage effect I
00:09:19.720 believe now battle phase attack into the
00:09:23.000 SP this is so that we can open up our
00:09:27.800 zones and then we you're going to go
00:09:29.880 effect of Rage to go up into a copy of
00:09:39.040 Yama and then we are going to also get
00:09:41.839 Yama effect and they just scoop it up
00:09:43.399 there realizing they have lost you know
00:09:45.120 we can just add back whatever draw for
00:09:47.000 turn um and we draw a copy of prison as
00:09:49.839 well you saw we us using the Sama a
00:09:52.160 little bit more that's cuz we have a lot
00:09:53.240 more graveyard set up right now and like
00:09:54.800 we don't want to add back the cave of
00:09:56.079 shavara because shavara doesn't do very
00:09:58.160 much in the graveyard but being being a
00:09:59.560 to add back the copy of sarama you have
00:10:01.680 like the sarama effect that can set a
00:10:03.200 copy of a card destroying it you can
00:10:04.880 even set the traps and destroy the traps
00:10:06.440 as well then you have the shyama be able
00:10:08.200 to destroy the copy of itself being able
00:10:10.240 to bring back out or you can just link
00:10:11.600 away in something better like a rage or
00:10:12.959 an anguish which we already have gone
00:10:14.320 through so we're not going be able to do
00:10:15.360 that but we end up taking the game here
00:10:17.600 we did misplay a bit by you know not
00:10:20.640 destroying a card which doesn't Target
00:10:23.279 very important that you do not make
00:10:25.079 those mistakes um you know know your
00:10:27.800 cards unfortunately it it does kind of
00:10:29.760 happen it's like while our opponent like
00:10:33.440 doesn't necessarily like cheat us but uh
00:10:35.880 we should have told them oh it does not
00:10:37.600 Target but a lot of the times you know
00:10:39.600 force of nature you go Target back row
00:10:43.399 and they go and then they chain but it's
00:10:45.279 like okay well it's it's targeting on
00:10:46.959 resolution it doesn't actually Target
00:10:48.480 just destroys but you mention it it's
00:10:50.920 like okay well if they flip it up and
00:10:52.440 then um they search or whatever it's
00:10:55.320 like okay well you know now we have a
00:10:57.399 little bit of Advantage we know they're
00:10:58.839 playing trap trick so they are playing
00:11:00.800 obviously other cards in their deck um
00:11:03.880 but still kind of useful but diving on
00:11:06.279 into game two we're going to be seeing
00:11:07.399 Labyrinth choosing to go first here
00:11:09.120 activating the copy of Shan Drager
00:11:10.639 discarding itself and a copy of storby
00:11:12.680 torby so opening up double those cards
00:11:14.839 here going to have a bunch of Labyrinth
00:11:18.440 set up we see them setting the regular
00:11:20.680 welcome setting a additional card here
00:11:22.560 and then we're going to be seeing lady
00:11:23.880 as well as a copy of the uh prison guy
00:11:27.880 Heavenly prison which is going to be a
00:11:29.440 pain in our ass you know this card makes
00:11:32.200 so we can't pop any face down cards
00:11:34.120 including our own um this was a
00:11:37.760 definitely attack played in Labyrinth
00:11:39.880 when unchain was popular unchain is not
00:11:42.079 very popular right now so there's really
00:11:44.079 no reason to play it I don't know why
00:11:45.279 they're playing it um but yeah it does
00:11:48.079 hurt we're going to be seeing a normal
00:11:49.639 summon of a Rua we're going to be seeing
00:11:51.680 a big welcome being flipped up here
00:11:54.839 before they can activate the copy of
00:11:56.320 lady we chain our copy of Shar here um
00:12:01.160 then they chain a copy of welcome we
00:12:02.639 chain a copy of a squirmer so we just
00:12:04.800 don't let that lady resolve its effects
00:12:06.440 we want to make sure that these
00:12:07.279 Labyrinth cards cannot get resources
00:12:09.440 cannot set those traps from the deck we
00:12:10.839 want to make sure that they're on as
00:12:12.079 little cards as possible here and we
00:12:13.880 have two ways of doing that with the
00:12:15.399 copy of squirmer as well as the copy of
00:12:17.560 srama uh that is absolutely crazy that
00:12:19.800 we end up opening up both of them here
00:12:22.160 very nice for us but uh we're going to
00:12:25.639 be able to see them summon out the copy
00:12:27.880 of I believe it was our
00:12:31.519 and the Ariana and bouncing it here um
00:12:35.920 and then we're going to be sing those
00:12:36.760 cars they do get to activate the effects
00:12:38.399 here chain link one chain link
00:12:41.720 two and then we do see the draw of the
00:12:45.240 Shand Drager once again and they will be
00:12:47.120 able to add back to hand and then summon
00:12:48.480 up the copy of story
00:12:50.120 torby now we get to summon up the copy
00:12:52.240 of Rua as well um doesn't really matter
00:12:56.279 how we do it
00:12:59.320 we're a disaster dog this is going to
00:13:01.279 essentially just let us go for that lady
00:13:03.680 here but in response to that summon
00:13:06.040 they're going to be able to activate the
00:13:07.440 effect of the Shand drag just carding
00:13:09.959 the Aras to be able to set a card to
00:13:11.720 their deck which from their deck which
00:13:13.839 is going to be the field spell here this
00:13:15.760 is going to make it so that we can no
00:13:16.839 longer Target the lady with card effects
00:13:18.399 and we do have the Abomination prison as
00:13:19.880 well to be able to search we're going to
00:13:21.240 search for a copy of we have not normal
00:13:24.680 yet so going for an arua interesting
00:13:27.920 choice we could go for for a copy of
00:13:30.680 anything
00:13:32.240 else um but we are going to be
00:13:35.600 seeing I guess we did normal summon out
00:13:37.800 first the first thing we did
00:13:40.320 okay uh we're going to see disaster dog
00:13:43.639 Target and then we're going to be able
00:13:45.560 to Target the Ariana to go for a copy of
00:13:48.800 the Yama here the being them being
00:13:50.440 fiends is huge for us which can activate
00:13:52.720 it effects we unfortunately don't have
00:13:54.399 the copy of uh shavara in the graveyard
00:13:57.320 to add back which is unfortunate we get
00:13:59.160 for the Abomination was gble the trigger
00:14:00.920 and summon itself
00:14:07.240 out and now we can go for anguish if we
00:14:10.199 wanted
00:14:11.920 to I feel like we definitely go anguish
00:14:14.720 into the copy here of
00:14:18.000 the strawberry T which we're going to
00:14:20.120 activate and they're going to chain to
00:14:21.440 it which is going to get rid of itself
00:14:23.440 alongside that copy of uh the Shand
00:14:27.440 Drager to set a copy of big welcome I do
00:14:30.399 believe very unfortunate for us but it's
00:14:33.759 going to be fine here because we can
00:14:34.880 still continue to
00:14:45.480 play we can link away for the abyss
00:14:49.639 actor link if we wanted to which going
00:14:51.759 to set the copy
00:14:53.759 of we're going to have we're going to be
00:14:56.079 able to send the copy of schwarma uh but
00:14:58.440 we're going to be seeing the arua
00:15:00.120 targeting to destroy the copy of Anguish
00:15:03.000 and then we can go anguish alongside
00:15:05.320 Yama
00:15:09.160 here like we know they have no cards
00:15:11.279 left we just have to go battle phase to
00:15:13.199 destroy and we're going to also be able
00:15:15.199 to
00:15:16.279 do the copy
00:15:18.880 of in the hand no
00:15:22.000 okay abomination in the hand as well we
00:15:24.639 we have we have lots of options we're
00:15:26.079 going to go anguish summon
00:15:33.759 and we then
00:15:36.040 go a bomb
00:15:38.160 okay a bomb's going to activate
00:15:40.279 discarding the copy of the Trap we could
00:15:42.880 have set the Trap first before we did
00:15:45.079 the arua pop so that we could have
00:15:46.720 actually destroyed off the Yama popping
00:15:48.480 the copy of
00:15:49.839 chamber and we try popping the lady here
00:15:53.240 and Lady does
00:15:55.240 not a bomb doesn't Target
00:16:00.519 I'm pretty sure lady says it can't be D
00:16:03.519 it can't be targeted do it also it
00:16:05.160 cannot be destroyed no surely
00:16:09.560 not I'm pretty sure it doesn't that's
00:16:11.759 first read it
00:16:13.759 here oh yeah it can't be destroyed by
00:16:15.759 card effects either
00:16:19.360 okay uh we couldn't even destroy our set
00:16:22.000 because they had the effect of the uh
00:16:26.440 prison up I guess as well so let's go go
00:16:29.079 battle phase and then we attack here and
00:16:31.800 this might be enough for game we have
00:16:34.480 3,00 2,24 plus 15 and we had to beat
00:16:39.160 over the lady so it's not exact game um
00:16:42.040 it is pretty close so we able to go into
00:16:46.120 a copy of
00:16:48.680 Rage I mean in this m I feel like we
00:16:50.959 should just go into the Yama first
00:17:00.519 we go anguish plus the arua into yama
00:17:04.000 then Yama and shabara into the copy of
00:17:06.319 Rage just get that additional body um or
00:17:09.359 that additional Yama in the graveyard
00:17:18.480 there you still have two cards we're
00:17:20.400 just going to go right into that copy of
00:17:22.919 the rage here maybe having an escape in
00:17:25.640 the hand or being able to set the
00:17:28.199 chamber here which probably should be an
00:17:30.080 escape but we won't be able to pop cards
00:17:32.160 so it's kind of like unfortunate for
00:17:39.559 us we're definitely not linking away
00:17:42.160 right yeah we're just going to set one
00:17:45.480 and then pass turn on
00:17:48.480 that and the first action we could do is
00:17:51.360 activate but they're going to be
00:17:52.320 activating the prison instead here and
00:17:54.520 that's going to be hard for
00:17:57.039 us to deal with but they are on very low
00:18:06.200 cards we're going to see welcome
00:18:08.240 Labyrinth going to be flipped face up
00:18:10.679 and we kind of don't want to interact
00:18:11.880 directly with any of the labyrinth cards
00:18:13.240 because we don't want that copy of Ario
00:18:15.039 to summon itself out on the summon here
00:18:17.080 we can then go rage and we can't Target
00:18:20.720 it so we can't
00:18:22.679 even do that cuz they still have the
00:18:24.600 field spell
00:18:26.159 here we attempt to go rage but they have
00:18:29.360 a face down still and I don't think they
00:18:31.320 have any plans to activate the face down
00:18:32.880 anytime soon they're going to go big
00:18:35.640 welcome to
00:18:36.200 [Music]
00:18:39.200 bounce and we are going to be chaining
00:18:41.559 the copy of
00:18:45.000 Escape targeting our rage alongside the
00:18:48.159 copy of the
00:18:54.000 arua they're going to chain RS here
00:19:00.400 it's going to be
00:19:03.760 fine and then we will see rage as well
00:19:06.679 as the rage going to be adding the copy
00:19:09.200 of shavara and then we're going to be
00:19:10.400 seeing the arua summon a copy of shyama
00:19:12.679 from the deck uh we can then go chamber
00:19:15.799 bring back out the copy of rage and then
00:19:18.799 rage can use the copy of Aras to
00:19:21.080 actually go for or we're going right
00:19:22.600 into the copy of sama that we're going
00:19:24.120 to be seeing the chamber go for that
00:19:26.840 rage and then rage can and then use the
00:19:29.440 copy
00:19:31.240 of the RS to go for an
00:19:36.200 SP and SP can banish a copy of I'm just
00:19:40.520 going to say a welcome or maybe a lady
00:19:43.039 in the
00:19:46.159 graveyard or the face down as well yeah
00:19:48.520 that's a good
00:19:50.200 option and so now they're kind of forced
00:19:52.400 to have anything
00:19:54.000 else which I don't believe they have
00:19:59.799 they can go for a tyon angle if they
00:20:01.720 wanted
00:20:06.039 to but we have we have everything the
00:20:09.400 game is essentially a so you're going to
00:20:10.799 go into a Typhon here
00:20:13.200 and they're going to attack into the SP
00:20:16.760 we take some damage but like it's quite
00:20:25.080 fine they're going to activate the
00:20:26.919 effect to bounce back the copy of a bomb
00:20:28.760 mination miss making sure that we can't
00:20:30.760 attack without destroying something else
00:20:32.360 here but we have our copy of shabara in
00:20:34.640 the hand as well to be able to do stuff
00:20:36.720 and then we also have a Cham or a copy
00:20:38.720 of sarama being able to destroy a trap
00:20:40.679 and just being able to trigger we have
00:20:41.919 the squirmer in the hand as well to be
00:20:44.480 able to summon and like we just have
00:20:45.600 Extender on Extender on Extender on
00:20:48.360 extender Our Deck is all gas no breaks
00:20:51.080 and this dog is Breaking the
00:20:55.679 Chain we're going to see Sama Target in
00:20:58.320 the copy of disaster destroying the
00:21:00.000 disaster and that's going to be able to
00:21:01.600 activate effects and then we can summon
00:21:03.919 out the anguish
00:21:05.760 here and then anguish can actually use
00:21:08.280 the copy of
00:21:10.880 the um to go into a copy
00:21:14.240 of the uh Abomination and then we're
00:21:17.960 just going to go affect Target destroy
00:21:19.520 summon attack that's just going to be
00:21:21.039 game for us here you know after a little
00:21:22.919 bit of a struggle with those face down
00:21:24.480 cards we end up taking the game here
00:21:26.279 which is quite nice we did have the copy
00:21:27.760 of cosmic in the hand as well so if they
00:21:29.120 would have been able to play through it
00:21:30.120 we would have been able to cos one of
00:21:31.159 their back rows being able to hit a big
00:21:32.720 welcome was quite nice but hopefully you
