00:12:02.320 crazy
00:12:04.040 obnoxious the leader that says I'm just
00:12:06.200 going to heal every turn hit me pretty
00:12:09.240 much which is slightly
00:12:13.190 [Music]
00:12:20.639 disrespectful because
00:12:23.010 [Music]

00:12:57.760 what are the odds like at that point
00:13:00.000 like you exhausted most of your [ __ ]
00:13:01.760 anyway and that's the other thing is
00:13:03.720 that's not getting dropped until I start
00:13:05.480 it's pretty much uh a rush yob but
00:13:08.560 better like in a way right yeah it just
00:13:11.040 doesn't pop something but it smacks it
00:13:13.040 pretty hard so it gives you the option
00:13:14.480 do you want to pitch 2K I should be
00:13:18.120 getting you tripping quick too I'm like

00:16:32.420 [Music]
00:16:33.920 does
00:16:35.560 keep I
00:16:44.519 think
00:16:46.600 spr you took out what I took out the two
00:16:49.199 commies and the third L for uh to the
00:16:54.240 three really good events three so I'm
00:16:57.480 playing uh three zero drop three reject
00:17:01.079 three Maru and I left kingdom come at
00:17:05.000 too because that's
00:17:06.520 [Music]
00:17:07.799 funny you only
00:17:11.160 usually and it's just a bomb you just
00:17:14.160 drop
00:17:16.530 [Music]
00:17:24.160 that and what's your effect on the
00:17:29.080 a turn and play a five drop because he
00:17:31.679 boosted the cabish to 7K when he SW it
00:17:34.360 the second time it was already
00:17:37.240 attached no but what I'm saying is is
00:17:39.679 you T four plus 1000 and so what he end
00:17:43.039 up doing was he swung naked he played
00:17:45.400 the first two drop swung naked Resto it
00:17:47.720 and then dropped the BL Resto it play
00:17:49.520 One Piece if you want to swing naked SW
00:17:51.320 it done used four for the effect Resto
00:17:54.880 it and then [ __ ] swung it take two
00:17:57.080 play a third blocker and I'm just like
00:17:59.400 this man just did like 177 da wor of
00:18:02.159 plays on 10 that character that leader
00:18:05.000 has potential now that we have the new
00:18:07.159 Supernova stuff all it needed was just
00:18:09.679 more good supernovas the downside is his
00:18:12.280 ability is still heavy as never he's a
00:18:14.880 vanilla leader until
00:18:17.200 8ti he is that leader is ass unless you
00:18:20.240 could
00:18:22.360 spam so also we made the decision that
00:18:25.159 we're also going to implement two Lins
00:18:27.400 in the deck as well because it's just
00:18:29.840 kind of like it's just a big body wolf
00:18:32.480 mandatory one why Target
00:18:34.720 F no
00:18:38.280 uh I love this I want to
00:18:43.960 play only need know one thing to win the
00:18:49.120 match if they can't have Cav
00:18:53.360 they's going to get you Ral

00:18:59.600 cabin dish is that a cat cafe he's
00:19:01.080 playing what you were attempting to
00:19:02.559 build I think I played that game at one
00:19:05.320 point ex I played the one where it was
00:19:07.360 like a bunch of cats in like a like a
00:19:09.400 camping kind of thing where like they
00:19:10.880 all had their own little like houses and
00:19:12.679 [ __ ] I'm playing this very greedy
00:19:15.039 because I was like commie doesn't K's
00:19:19.000 been underperforming in the way I'm
00:19:20.880 playing it because I have to respect W
00:19:23.520 so I took out the the thing with tomie
00:19:26.000 is that it it helps you the law
00:19:37.200 botom and then they have to just start
00:19:39.120 raw swinging into it it's a two
00:19:42.159 or it's it's a three
00:19:48.880 yeah

00:23:33.400 me a deck and someone wants to sponsor
00:23:35.200 me I'll how much for me yeah that's
00:23:38.520 where I'm at I'm not buying one somebody
00:23:42.080 you still got
00:23:43.120 price
00:23:54.520 prob
00:23:56.200 12 122k two 1K and how many Z like you
00:24:02.960 know 105 but if I can't that's more than
00:24:06.520 enough counter dogs how
00:24:09.360 know your stuff still right here that's
00:24:11.919 what I'm this stuff I'm probably not
00:24:13.919 going to pick up I think I told you that
00:24:15.880 actually I you
00:24:18.200 didn't what's your opinion on arong you
00:24:20.360 think I I have out of four but I can
00:24:22.919 drop it down to a two andun I mean you
00:24:24.919 need
00:24:26.000 vanilla you need vanilla
00:24:32.480 I told you collection I'm not trying to
00:24:34.120 pick up when you put it down you
00:24:37.919 got this
00:24:56.760 is what's your normal
00:24:59.000 work really well against like
00:25:02.080 6065
00:25:14.240 ofr bger than
00:25:16.640 else besides like or Nami if
00:25:21.399 they like those are the only two Decks
00:25:23.480 that should be competing with
00:25:26.159 a come early earlier
00:25:31.799 you have
00:25:35.720 counter said person you bring you get
00:25:38.640 extra
00:25:42.039 pack you can also just play in
00:25:49.880 a
00:25:51.480 and while soong might just be what you
00:25:54.399 have to
00:25:55.600 playing like I feel like I'm
00:25:59.360 well you also have to
00:26:01.039 respect which
00:26:03.200 respecting and sakazuki and all the
00:26:05.440 leaders have to turn sideways are real
00:26:08.320 problem for me the thing is is that they
00:26:10.399 can't turn their leader sideways to use
00:26:12.360 the
00:26:13.760 effect well I'm looking at as um that
00:26:17.240 effects as your leader or leer attack
00:26:19.399 next turn use your effect
00:26:23.039 ah get off loose
00:26:28.440 like just raw dropping KN Hawk unless
00:26:30.080 you need to recover a board State it's
00:26:32.480 it doesn't feel good un playing unless
00:26:36.200 you're playing because ARL has like a
00:26:39.120 mediate
00:26:41.360 effect yeah but you also have to look at
00:26:44.039 how many times is that about to get
00:26:46.200 swung at the next turn oh every time
00:26:48.360 that's why I do it like
00:26:50.159 that he's also a
00:26:52.520 blocker battle either way you're getting
00:26:55.159 Val I guess it's how much do you want to
00:26:57.159 commit 31 yeah I prot unless it's like
00:27:07.480 and2
00:27:09.760 requ
00:27:11.520 chok I'll
00:27:13.559 swing you go seven and it's like damn I
00:27:16.159 don't want to give you a 2K you can have
00:27:17.960 it but like if that's your only swing
00:27:20.159 I'm
00:27:28.679 freezing curses to negate Colossus is
00:27:32.120 this you know what the OD car
00:27:36.760 no how many
