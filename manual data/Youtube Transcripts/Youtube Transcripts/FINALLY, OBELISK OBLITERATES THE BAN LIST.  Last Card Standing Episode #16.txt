00:30:39.360 effect of itself but for the whole turn
00:30:43.120 and the player injector cards are good
00:30:47.200 all right are we going to get punished
00:30:48.880 here did we overc commit into the wrong
00:30:50.480 board cuz these are just vanillas right
00:30:52.960 now all right what are we going to do
00:30:54.799 about this Chron smiger B ising to add
00:30:58.080 Chron impact here normal summon out the
00:31:01.120 citry sets three cards and passes it
00:31:03.880 doesn't look like much but that's
00:31:04.880 legitimately the best like Chron outcome
00:31:07.000 you could ask for here all right they're
00:31:08.919 going to go fossil Fusion fossil Fusion
00:31:10.799 banishes the powered and zectron summons
00:31:12.519 out the skull wagon and now we're going
00:31:14.519 to go drag down to the Grave here gets
00:31:16.720 rid of the controller draws a free card
00:31:18.440 here rips his own Nemesis I don't know
00:31:20.480 why we're playing drag down that's very
00:31:22.000 odd all right links up into triple burst
00:31:25.399 dragon can Nega the damage step we need
00:31:27.519 to here skull uh
00:31:29.360 sarua um boost the attack here Chron
00:31:32.720 impact is Chained by the pop effect here
00:31:34.840 of the skull gar brings back the this
00:31:37.120 ver from the banish pile battle phase
00:31:38.840 start steps Chron citri synchros up with
00:31:41.360 the mathematician goes into a six here
00:31:43.039 for the christon amatrix and sorry five
00:31:46.360 amatrix puts everything into defense
00:31:48.080 mode except the two Link monsters
00:31:50.440 interestingly KCK by all right oh and
00:31:54.000 now we're going to go teror of the over
00:31:55.360 route sends the sarua and sets the
00:31:57.480 Keystone to the field here and the
00:31:59.159 opponent gets to keep the uh triple
00:32:00.919 burst which clears the this bur does a
00:32:02.799 little bit of piercing damage and then
00:32:04.799 main phase two puts them into Attack
00:32:06.080 Mode sets a card and end phase gets
00:32:08.000 dusted on a duster all right uh Chris
00:32:11.639 John you got to do something here got to
00:32:13.440 set set up a really uh big play cuz this
00:32:16.320 isn't really much here adds a sner with
00:32:19.080 this Fern sner effect going to discard
00:32:21.399 citri special summoning itself out here
00:32:23.240 poping itself that's going to get out
00:32:25.159 from the deck here is smiger smiger pops
00:32:27.840 the amatrix okay summons out Quan
00:32:30.000 amatrix floats into the sner that's
00:32:33.039 going to Synchro up into quandax got
00:32:35.240 four and five here into the battle phase
00:32:36.720 attack over the Keystone and then main
00:32:39.320 Phase 2 set one
00:32:41.360 pass okay what are we going to make here
00:32:43.519 this is a nine Synchro play but with two
00:32:45.279 materials that's not really that's not
00:32:47.360 Coran gandra basically the hell does
00:32:49.720 triple burst do he's having effect here
00:32:51.919 someone out the Miss radiant trap tracks
00:32:54.480 Target the sner makes it uneffected Ed
00:32:57.440 by Lance chain the Chon impact to
00:33:00.200 protect it from targeting that's insane
00:33:02.120 okay so I think trap track pops the sner
00:33:04.600 and then sets a trap that you can use
00:33:06.039 this
00:33:06.679 turn pops the S efner sets an impact
00:33:10.240 resolution s efner floats plus impact
00:33:14.000 brings back this ver this ver is a 3
00:33:17.080 four 7 plus two that's going to be nine
00:33:19.559 here with two tuners oh wait no we're
00:33:21.320 not going for quar and gandra four wait
00:33:23.799 what are we doing here oh Trula Dragon
00:33:25.880 of the sub that Trish jump scare
00:33:28.880 banishing the entire field here and
00:33:31.880 finally clearing everything with the
00:33:33.320 Chron deck holy crap would you expect
00:33:35.519 that level 11 Synchro play thought he
00:33:37.480 was going to go for quarian gandra but
00:33:39.080 no level 11 it is all right uh one
00:33:42.440 little problem here your opponent's on
00:33:43.720 8,000 life points you can't give them
00:33:45.360 too long to try and top deck something
00:33:46.919 here smiger is going to banish itself to
00:33:49.159 add a trap here we're going to take a
00:33:50.919 Chron entry from the deck and uh we're
00:33:53.039 still going to pop off here with sner
00:33:54.519 pitching the Trap card summoning itself
00:33:56.600 popping itself and now we're floating up
00:33:58.559 into a thiser rosenick getting a token
00:34:01.080 here all right normal summons at the
00:34:03.799 Ryon and punches for uh 32 here and I
00:34:07.840 think this is a bit of a scary Synchro
00:34:09.760 setup we've got all right we got quandax
00:34:11.839 that's
00:34:12.960 437 ryion I think is the hand Synchro
00:34:16.440 drag around to the Grave here we got a
00:34:17.679 foolish burial that's useless Keystone
00:34:20.119 this is a very very convoluted upstart
00:34:22.320 Goblin you're using here my friend set
00:34:24.520 one card end phase quand synchros up
00:34:26.679 into seven goes into dragster spell and
00:34:28.918 trap negate and I think that's uh exact
00:34:32.159 lethal on board here with a negate but
00:34:34.079 it does reduce the level so it might not
00:34:35.599 be enough here but 27 connects and 21 is
00:34:39.079 GG we're going to the finals with chra
00:34:43.079 is it a mirror match oh my God no it's
00:34:46.320 ancient gears versus chrison in the
00:34:49.480 final all right normal summon Gen X undy
00:34:52.918 send this ver that's a good start here
00:34:55.839 add the Gen X control this banishing
00:34:58.480 that's going to add a here that's sner
00:35:02.119 if we ever did need one which we are
00:35:03.760 going to use now to discard the entry
00:35:05.640 summoning itself popping to set up a
00:35:08.680 smiger a turtle we're going to hit the
00:35:11.000 turtle here and now that's going to give
00:35:12.359 us a citry with two set cards I'm going
00:35:14.359 to be real with you 2 plus three plus a
00:35:17.200 fist ver that's a that's a nine play on
00:35:19.480 our opponent's turn there I'm just
00:35:20.880 saying if anyone here wants to do some
00:35:23.040 maths no that's a five 2+ three two
00:35:27.000 Target three that makes five 5 + 3 is
00:35:29.640 eight uh that's not nine either wow what
00:35:32.480 is maths Synchro summoning is bad okay
00:35:35.359 we got Clockwork Knight being activated
00:35:37.400 Here and Now normal summon silver Gadget
00:35:41.440 wow Robbie Cole would be so proud of you
00:35:43.079 right now dude I'm just saying all right
00:35:45.599 uh the gadgets have hit the field here
00:35:47.160 we got the ancient gear frame frame
00:35:49.839 frame frame XC shokan into gear Gigan
00:35:53.720 X all right is it time to D disrupt the
00:35:57.400 opponent shall we do something did we
00:36:00.400 get
00:36:01.200 smiger okay it's time to disrupt it's
00:36:03.720 time to disrupt all right we're going to
00:36:04.880 go citry Target the turtle here that is
00:36:07.200 a four Synchro 4 plus 3 7 and if you go
00:36:10.200 impact into something
00:36:12.560 quandax got to toggle on when you play
00:36:14.680 Chron all the time you know did we just
00:36:16.599 pass
00:36:17.839 priority no we are toggled on although
00:36:19.880 the opponent does have a quick play
00:36:20.960 quandax effect to Synchro 4 plus 3 7
00:36:23.560 chain the impact who we targeting who we
00:36:25.839 targeting who we targeting
00:36:27.319 Target citry Cory and gandra requires
00:36:29.960 two tuners for some reason uh lore I
00:36:32.640 guess and is Shawn going to have an
00:36:34.920 answer to this two cards left in hand
00:36:37.240 after using a normal summon I don't know
00:36:42.200 man
00:36:43.720 godamn Coran gandra hits the field here
00:36:47.280 and activates his is it just monsters
00:36:49.319 Target monsters in the field in the
00:36:50.480 graveyard and the graveyard by the way
00:36:52.599 ban gandra banishing the gigant X and
00:36:54.760 the gear frame from the uh field
00:36:57.200 I'm very concerned as to what this quick
00:36:59.720 effect that Shawn seems to have here is
00:37:02.480 I don't know we'll see if that's like
00:37:03.839 actually a relevant thing in a moment
00:37:05.880 okay Coran gandra resolves sets a card
00:37:08.200 and passes Shawn does not have anything
00:37:10.200 else here this is looking rough 8,000
00:37:12.440 damage is a lot to Chomp through though
00:37:13.720 for christon let's see what we can do
00:37:15.400 here although to be fair we've got kind
00:37:17.200 of a big setup here we got sner in the
00:37:19.240 grave we got three cards in hand how are
00:37:20.920 Chron and drron related bro what do you
00:37:23.119 mean they have like six out of eight of
00:37:25.920 their letters

00:37:34.839 into my real
00:37:36.760 house all right we're floating ryion out
00:37:39.119 the deck here that's a level three
00:37:40.480 Quarry and gandra by the way how did you
00:37:42.359 reduce gandra his level by the way oh
00:37:44.960 double chuner oh no one chuner is this a
00:37:47.720 Trish play please Trish him please Trish

00:38:18.040 employees lethal company game or
00:38:20.000 something all right uh we are just

00:38:35.920 trap negate and coral dragon draws a
00:38:37.560 card it's main phase one by the way
00:38:39.680 looks like that's enough for us as we
00:38:41.400 proceed to the battle phase and
00:38:43.119 deal 41 damage is my mass wrong it
00:38:47.000 sounds kind of wrong doesn't it my I
00:38:48.400 always question my mass there it is 41

00:39:02.319 a good top deck we got normal summon
00:39:04.400 wyvern I'm going to be honest like
00:39:06.119 ancient gears on one card versus a
00:39:08.920 dragster I don't know I feel like you're
00:39:10.640 in a bad spot here but to be fair they
00:39:12.160 can punch over it okay we're adding box
00:39:13.960 with the wyver here that gets to get a
00:39:16.560 gear frame I didn't realize San had so

00:40:00.680 ancient gear but the flood gate effect
00:40:01.839 is not really relevant unless uh you
00:40:03.960 pair it with something like tikaboo or
00:40:06.000 rivalry uh to be fair the the The
00:40:07.880 Floodgate we're Banning this time is
