00:00:00.599 Master duel the greatest platform for
00:00:03.040 card gamery of all time never before has
00:00:06.160 an online simulator played better looked
00:00:08.360 sleeker and shockingly cost less let's
00:00:12.160 push this game to its limits and see
00:00:13.880 what we can do with even less welcome to
00:00:17.039 master of faster season
00:00:20.119 2 folks welcome to the new season of
00:00:23.480 Master of faster this time we're going
00:00:26.119 to be playing against the one the only
00:00:28.480 gah
00:00:31.960 how do we change our
00:00:38.960 name got him NBT has invited me on as
00:00:42.239 his competitor for the second season of
00:00:44.480 the fastest Series in Yu-Gi-Oh Master he
00:00:47.160 did hit up in fact the master of faster
00:00:49.879 concierge of quickness I will defeat
00:00:52.719 Joseph this season I think the boys kind
00:00:55.120 of just winged it last season they just
00:00:56.640 went anything goes see what works out
00:00:58.879 I've come prepared with even a whole
00:01:00.800 checklist to go under right this is
00:01:02.840 going to keep our thoughts organized
00:01:04.400 while we're clicking buttons in the
00:01:05.799 master game trying to get as many gems
00:01:08.040 as we can before we get to Du today so
00:01:09.960 while I was happy with where my list
00:01:11.240 ended up I did bite off a little bit
00:01:13.000 more than I could chew with Labyrinth
00:01:14.640 and my deck kind of sucked ass for about
00:01:16.680 a week and a half so we're going to
00:01:18.040 start with a constructed quality deck
00:01:19.759 that doesn't take a lot of URS that we
00:01:22.040 should be able to have by the end of the
00:01:23.240 first episode so just like last time
00:01:25.000 we're going to get 15 minutes on the
00:01:26.360 clock but we're going to do a couple of
00:01:27.439 things differently the winner of each
00:01:29.040 episode gets an addition addal minute
00:01:30.960 for the next week and secondly we are
00:01:34.200 going to be playing the duels on the
00:01:36.119 short timer I'm excited to show off what
00:01:38.840 we got so I think we're ready to start
00:01:41.280 this run I'm so nervous chat I am so
00:01:43.399 nervous I want to do so well all right
00:01:46.280 and let's begin now okay first things
00:01:48.759 first solo mode open it up so the first
00:01:51.280 thing we learned last time is that we
00:01:52.520 don't actually have to use uh The Loner
00:01:55.320 in order to uh do the solo mode we're to
00:01:57.719 change the deck from the starting that
00:01:59.560 they give to the link generation not
00:02:02.039 starting deck how about power of the
00:02:03.680 Dragon instead if I've learned anything
00:02:05.880 from Nuzlocke runs that I've done before
00:02:08.000 it's that the bot they just attack into
00:02:10.280 text Changers willy-nilly
00:02:12.800 oh this looks so much better already I
00:02:15.480 don't need to know this okay like I said
00:02:17.920 opponents are too dumb they're going to
00:02:19.519 attack into Tex changer and I'm going to
00:02:21.519 pass turn let him poke into it summon my
00:02:23.319 Big D that shit's crazy you know I
00:02:25.720 consider myself a little bit of a lord
00:02:26.920 of D myself negate the attack scoot it
00:02:29.239 over he gets attack in there but I don't
00:02:31.599 really care about that I have big 2800
00:02:33.440 bungus on the field now well my
00:02:34.760 opponent's really outplaying me
00:02:36.480 here and our deck is kind of outplaying
00:02:38.800 me too 2 minutes this is actually is
00:02:41.200 that good Pace this feels like longer
00:02:42.720 than I wanted it to be bming it is
00:02:44.680 actually optimal to BM because we want
00:02:46.200 to be taking actions that take like 2
00:02:47.800 seconds like tributing go back all right
00:02:50.640 that's one down 2 minutes and 30 seconds
00:02:53.239 feels a little slow that took us 2
00:02:54.920 minutes we're on a great Pace here
00:02:56.680 boomman all right Ry geki added to the
00:02:58.519 collection I love it do these Miss get
00:03:00.200 completed from solo mode I assumed so am
00:03:02.599 I
00:03:04.599 wrong there it is I cannot lose with the
00:03:07.519 gelatin cannon in my hand next up 11
00:03:11.200 minutes on the clock we're getting out
00:03:12.319 of these real quick like I said these
00:03:14.480 bozos attack check text changer so we're
00:03:16.560 going to pick this up all we got to get
00:03:18.080 through is this third duel and we will
00:03:19.480 be golden because this is where the gems
00:03:21.799 are hidden that would have been the
00:03:23.159 silliest waste of cards in the game are
00:03:25.840 they learning wait this guy's huge what

00:06:28.599 going to do a little bit of a we're
00:06:29.880 going to do a little bit of uh utilizing
00:06:32.440 the uh the time we're given in this duel
00:06:34.120 for me to change all my settings I you
00:06:35.880 know I actually have to do the exact
00:06:37.240 same thing uh yeah I know I don't even

00:06:44.599 fantastic man I'll definitely say uh
00:06:46.680 you'll see by my first play here exactly
00:06:48.599 how I did oh for my first turn I am
00:06:51.720 going to set one I am going to set two
00:06:55.520 and you know what just to be safe I'm
00:06:57.639 going to add a set monster the mix it
00:06:59.759 return dualist what do you play did you
00:07:02.199 get Labyrinth on episode one that's
00:07:04.560 insane you specifically told me not to
00:07:06.960 play Labyrinth so me being a good I did
00:07:09.759 not do that all right well let's see
00:07:11.919 what you're working with I I'll begin
00:07:13.160 with a Swords of Revealing Light oh I
00:07:16.000 guess you'll see what's up you flipped
00:07:17.919 up my
00:07:20.240 protron Gage what the [ __ ] is this
00:07:22.479 listen listen man I 15 minutes not as
00:07:25.720 long as I thought it was dude not as
00:07:27.639 long as I thought
00:07:30.319 Gage if those set cards are jelly Cannon
00:07:32.479 I don't know what to tell I don't think
00:07:33.560 it's going to save you this time well I
00:07:35.039 mean you expected s right like what do
00:07:38.240 we have yeah let's see if you expect
00:07:39.479 this let's go momental and anguish I you
00:07:43.800 picked up an entire momento deck off of
00:07:48.120 your first 15 minutes I will say I was
00:07:50.960 ready to come in here really
00:07:52.039 disappointed because I think my deck
00:07:53.479 isn't nearly as good as it could have
00:07:54.919 been I I like misapplied some of my
00:07:57.520 stuff within the last couple of minutes
00:07:59.639 uh and then I watched you set uh protron
00:08:02.039 and now I'm feeling a lot better yeah I
00:08:03.560 was about to say you think your deck is
00:08:05.159 not up to where it needs to be man I I
00:08:07.800 ain't got a deck at
00:08:09.520 all what did we just do we just uh
00:08:11.960 needlebug nested for five we're going to
00:08:13.919 trigger all these all right man MH let
00:08:16.840 me show me you got a Sprite Elf
00:08:18.720 somewhere in there too already uh no no
00:08:21.560 um that's not how this deck works
00:08:24.520 okay okay so here's the problem is I can
00:08:27.159 barely execute this in time in
00:08:30.400 TCG uh yeah how's the time looking over
00:08:32.719 there for you what how much you got
00:08:34.559 left I don't have that much I think I'm
00:08:37.039 supposed to get Fusion here I love these
00:08:39.320 cards man I don't know if you've been
00:08:40.599 playing any Master duel these cards are
00:08:42.719 tight as hell I've been playing a little
00:08:44.720 bit I kind of like this archetype I like
00:08:46.360 the big 5,000 bungus it can bring out oh
00:08:48.920 yeah dude's pretty nasty I also like how
00:08:51.440 these are all like Throwbacks to Old
00:08:53.080 School yuio cards I really dig that
00:08:54.920 they've been doing that for this uh we
00:08:57.200 will grab speaking of the big ass guy
00:08:59.519 him yeah big bungus big
00:09:05.640 bungus oh my God we're down to 80
00:09:07.920 Seconds already I that's more than
00:09:09.720 enough time that's a you've been moving
00:09:12.240 pretty fast I think that's possible I'm
00:09:13.959 trying here I'm
00:09:16.839 trying I'm going to still fix my
00:09:18.680 settings now that you're just having a
00:09:20.560 good time okay let's see here
00:09:34.839 uh I guess we'll grab bone party
00:09:37.920 here and then uh I'm going to try and
00:09:40.320 eat your entire board I think no you can
00:09:43.360 you can eat my entire Board of protron
00:09:45.399 to back row you know what I'm going to
00:09:47.760 eat my swords too I don't need it all
00:09:50.279 right why
00:09:54.079 not oh man you got an airu or something
00:09:58.880 yeah you think you think I don't know
00:10:01.240 man I feel like this was a disaster I
00:10:03.079 feel like you maybe know a couple extra
00:10:05.279 strats more than I do and that's how
00:10:07.120 you're able to fit all this in 15
00:10:08.720 minutes it's maybe possible I could the
00:10:12.600 spell trap don't hit the right one man
00:10:14.600 don't destroy my jelly Cannon my [ __ ]
00:10:16.839 jelly Cannon you got to stop putting him
00:10:19.240 in the middle man I've learned nothing
00:10:22.079 dude I've learned
00:10:24.880 nothing what's your time looking like is
00:10:27.480 a time win possible here
00:10:30.040 uh uh it's about 30 seconds I may have
00:10:32.040 to stop uh stop doing stuff yeah I think
00:10:35.560 I have to like chill
00:10:37.959 uh-oh uh uh wa what's
00:10:43.639 up okay big bungus so far you're doing
00:10:46.720 okay man I believe in you I know I know

00:10:51.839 animations right that's got to be
00:10:52.959 important I am down to uh 20 seconds
00:10:56.000 which is not really what I'm looking for
00:10:57.680 but uh unun let's just let's just go
00:10:59.120 back

00:11:06.480 to add any cyers monster from my dect to
00:11:09.079 hand I'm going to take as much time as
