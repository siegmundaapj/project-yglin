# https://www.youtube.com/watch/WqVIMDA8EHI

00:00:00.480 what is good everybody this is Charles
00:00:01.560 team CG coming at you guys here with a
00:00:03.439 testing video with the new format new
00:00:05.120 band list and everything uh my buddy
00:00:06.600 here is rocking runic Thunder Dragons
00:00:08.960 and I've been on the venish soul
00:00:10.559 technique as of late I really enjoy
00:00:13.040 Vanquish Soul as a deck like this deck
00:00:14.400 is kind of like interesting it's not
00:00:15.240 like a huge combo deck but like you have
00:00:16.600 to be really smart with like your
00:00:18.000 resources and timing your interruptions
00:00:20.080 and stuff and I do plan to bre like a
00:00:21.480 deck profile and stuff I just got to
00:00:22.480 figure out I'm missing a few spots in
00:00:24.400 the extra deck that I don't know what to
00:00:25.439 put in there and I just need to sit down
00:00:27.160 and figure it out but we end up losing
00:00:28.760 the uh the good old dice roll here and
00:00:31.279 we're going to see upstart Goblin into
00:00:33.079 it a low Darkness to Vanishing I think
00:00:34.440 that's the thunder dragon Kaiju up there
00:00:36.360 um so he's like we if you guys want to
00:00:39.079 see a runic thunder dragon Deck Profile
00:00:40.440 let me know um I actually was very much
00:00:42.800 against this strategy but then I
00:00:43.879 realized like the deck is like honestly
00:00:47.000 no different than like any of the other
00:00:48.360 runic strategies out there the runic is
00:00:49.879 a complimenting engine you're pretty
00:00:51.079 much making a one-sided droll and uh
00:00:54.520 hoping that the opponent can uh while
00:00:56.359 you are drawing like a bunch of cards
00:00:58.879 with uh the runic f and everything so he
00:01:00.680 tries to make Colossus there but he it's
00:01:02.199 been a while since you know he's made
00:01:03.440 Colossus like hey you have to activate a
00:01:04.559 thunder dragon card from your hand
00:01:05.760 before you can make it he's like okay so
00:01:07.360 we go back and he ends up making it
00:01:08.720 correctly again this glare man I cannot
00:01:10.479 beat the glare at my locals and it's
00:01:11.720 just it's it's just upsetting there's
00:01:13.560 nothing I can do there's no place in the
00:01:15.799 entire store that does not have it but
00:01:17.840 we're going to see runic Fountain
00:01:18.680 touchdown here and he's going to go and
00:01:20.320 activate the runic flashing fire I
00:01:22.840 believe which is just he's going to use
00:01:23.920 that to summon out mugan he's going to
00:01:25.439 attempt mugan discard tactics and in my
00:01:27.920 hand I see I have DD Crow
00:01:30.400 which I like d Crow I know some people
00:01:31.560 are going to be like shifter is the way
00:01:32.720 but like I like d Crow because it's a
00:01:33.920 little bit more flexible and it's like
00:01:35.520 live later on even after versus like
00:01:38.680 shifter but shifter is in my side deck
00:01:40.119 because like this deck can play Under
00:01:41.399 shifter very well and uh shifter is a
00:01:45.079 blowout card
00:01:46.600 but Colossus hurts Colossus hurts so
00:01:50.680 we're going to Bell the runic Fountain I
00:01:53.719 believe you can bail running f as we
00:01:55.079 were reading I was like I'm pretty sure
00:01:55.960 you can bail it because it's attempting
00:01:56.960 to put cards from the from the de from
00:01:58.719 the grave back to the deck so we end up
00:02:00.719 Belling it he goes and activates a
00:02:02.759 second runic Fountain and then he tries
00:02:04.479 to see he's very new to
00:02:06.880 runic so he tries to I was like you
00:02:09.520 don't it's not on activation you have to
00:02:10.800 activate a runic quick play in order to
00:02:13.640 um get to put back and he ends up
00:02:16.560 drawing into tip then he activates
00:02:20.200 tip and then tip should give him the
00:02:23.519 spell he needs so then he activates
00:02:24.800 there we go we're just helping him out
00:02:25.920 here so he activates the second run
00:02:27.400 found activates tip to search and then
00:02:28.959 he pretty much gets to grab any of the
00:02:31.000 runic uh spell traps that he wants to
00:02:32.760 and then he can use that uh now he can
00:02:35.920 use the runic Fountain to put back three
00:02:37.879 to the bottom of the deck and then
00:02:39.440 draw three cards so this is like the
00:02:41.879 strategy like it's kind of built around
00:02:43.680 I believe is when he was exception of
00:02:45.080 this strategy you're supposed to put on
00:02:46.200 a Colossus and like pretty much a
00:02:48.319 one-sided you know drw as I said earlier
00:02:50.200 and then I you're going to out resource
00:02:51.680 your opponent because they can't search
00:02:52.920 red but you can still draw but we're
00:02:55.080 going to see a tribute summon of Hawk
00:02:56.599 and we're going to see a pitch of hawk
00:02:59.879 to S back
00:03:01.440 Roar and then I don't know did he make
00:03:04.360 an IP yep so thunder dragon Hawk's kind
00:03:06.200 of a cool card cuz like when it gets
00:03:07.360 sent to the graveyard it allows him to
00:03:10.000 like mull again I
00:03:14.840 believe which is kind of wild so you get
00:03:16.959 like really with Hawk and with all like
00:03:18.680 the rate cards you get to like perfectly
00:03:19.840 craft your hand but my hand's not
00:03:21.239 looking good I see dust devil Crow a
00:03:23.280 rise heart and I believe a vas se you
00:03:27.080 know just a rice
00:03:28.760 heart so dust devil Crow risee heart and
00:03:32.840 maybe a
00:03:34.000 Caesar Caesar's hands down like my
00:03:36.159 favorite uh vanal like 100% like that
00:03:39.480 card Caesar Valas takes the k for me so
00:03:42.560 yep we draw we draw raisin but we can't
00:03:44.400 add which isn't no we draw fin never
00:03:46.439 mind so he special from finer and finer
00:03:48.239 is an out to the Colossus if that's like
00:03:51.319 all that he had but conveniently you
00:03:52.799 know he has IP and stuff like that so uh
00:03:55.879 that
00:03:56.799 wouldn't it wouldn't be exactly
00:04:01.040 uh the out that we need because like
00:04:03.079 finer can crack into like you know th L
00:04:05.319 things but he's going to go ahead and
00:04:06.840 use the runic card here to attempt to
00:04:09.360 special but I tell him you have to
00:04:10.480 special sum to the extra monster zone so
00:04:15.680 guys always remember read your
00:04:17.959 cards just read your
00:04:20.358 cards however uh like I said Colossus is
00:04:22.759 still kind of like threatening
00:04:24.479 here and we're going to see a believe
00:04:27.280 that's runic tip to go grab one of the
00:04:28.960 other runic cards like a flashing fire
00:04:31.440 maybe I can't remember really much of
00:04:33.639 Eddie of the Eddie I even played Ric
00:04:35.160 generator so like I don't even have
00:04:36.360 flashing fire freezing curses and stuff
00:04:38.440 like that I think he needs to get the
00:04:40.039 one that either negates the Fin's effect
00:04:41.680 or he needs to get the one that will
00:04:44.120 um end up destroying
00:04:51.199 it so he attempts to go into I attemp to
00:04:55.600 go battle face but he goes into IP and I
00:04:58.479 should have on resolution I should F
00:05:00.240 here I don't think I don't think I
00:05:01.639 should have so I don't know I don't
00:05:04.120 think F could have actually triggered
00:05:05.320 there because it had been going back to
00:05:06.280 the deck but yeah like my opening hand
00:05:08.160 was pretty garbage but that that's just
00:05:10.320 how it goes right that's like how the
00:05:11.479 game of Yu-Gi-Oh is and that's something
00:05:13.919 else that's interesting is crow in this
00:05:15.039 matchup is kind of good and bad so it's
00:05:17.080 good to hit the runic spells to keep
00:05:18.600 them from getting more draws but it's
00:05:19.680 also bad to hit the D Thunder Dragons
00:05:21.400 because then their their effects will
00:05:22.880 trigger but we're going to get to go
00:05:24.759 first now and we're going to get to show
00:05:26.199 him the whole vanish Soul strategy here
00:05:27.800 but we're going to go and activate Stak
00:05:28.840 your soul revealing the DD Crow which
00:05:30.440 will allow us to grabb madlo or Borger
00:05:32.120 but we're going to go straight for mad
00:05:33.319 love and madlo is going to get us a
00:05:35.360 spell trap which I think we go for the
00:05:38.000 dust devil I really like dust devil I
00:05:39.600 know some people are all about the Trap
00:05:40.680 snow devil but I've caught myself a lot
00:05:42.520 more times going for like dust devil
00:05:44.759 because it feels like the um snow
00:05:47.400 Devil's just a win more but we're going
00:05:48.680 to normal summon raisin raisin effect to
00:05:50.400 go ahead and add XA long now if I know
00:05:52.400 there's any combos for the entire
00:05:54.440 Vanquish Soul it's uh the fact that uh
00:05:57.560 raisin plus additional fire is like a
00:05:59.440 full full setup here so we're going to
00:06:00.560 link into the Rock of the vanquisher use
00:06:01.919 Rock effect to add back use Xiao long to
00:06:03.600 reveal two fires to go ahead and add any
00:06:05.240 Vanquish
00:06:07.880 card Xiao long was Xiao Long's like
00:06:10.319 almost like they it should have been the
00:06:13.240 fire attribute that allows you to tag
00:06:14.599 out from the hand but they like knew
00:06:16.479 that having three tag outs might be too
00:06:18.199 strong so they decided to like make Shia
00:06:19.680 long like here you can like reveal and
00:06:22.240 as long as you revealing it's in hand
00:06:23.319 you can special summon so it's like kind
00:06:25.240 of like they did it like that but anyway
00:06:28.240 we're going to go ahead and grab the
00:06:29.280 board here instead I believe we go
00:06:31.960 Borger bounce back because we want to
00:06:33.360 get that draw and we go ahead and reveal
00:06:35.440 the B drct mad love draw a card we set
00:06:37.840 one card and I believe we set another so
00:06:39.919 during the opponents uh my buddy Matt
00:06:41.720 here draw phase we're going to go ahead
00:06:42.840 and go Borger effect to draw and then
00:06:44.800 we're going to change out long to
00:06:45.919 attempt to search and he's going to
00:06:47.319 chain flashing fire to destroy a set
00:06:49.400 spell or trap and I'm just checking to
00:06:51.840 see how many of that banishes so he ends
00:06:53.080 up hitting the snow devil then we Mill
00:06:54.639 or we banish four which is like a bell
00:06:56.919 two crow and a finer so like we're still
00:06:59.000 we're still pretty good here to go ahead
00:07:00.879 and search out the panta to get the
00:07:02.360 earth into the hand and then we're going
00:07:05.680 to go ahead and draw off of the Borger
00:07:09.680 now something else that's interested is
00:07:11.000 like the rock can bring down raisin into
00:07:12.840 like any of the zones that he summons
00:07:14.160 into and then raisin can grab me the
00:07:16.800 valley of Caesar which then we can start
00:07:18.319 doing what the deck does and right now
00:07:19.960 we have like tons of cardit we've been
00:07:21.400 able to acquire like a lot of Advantage
00:07:23.199 here and yeah that's like what raisin
00:07:25.599 plus a fire in your hand already does so
00:07:27.680 like use raisin search y long and then
00:07:29.120 you do this you're able to get like a ma
00:07:30.560 a really good setup here but we're going
00:07:31.639 to see runic tip activate over there in
00:07:33.840 the glare
00:07:34.800 Corner banishing an imperm so like he's
00:07:37.039 literally hit all non-engine not a
00:07:38.319 single Vanquish name has been hit which
00:07:39.879 I'm you know I'm happy about that's
00:07:42.280 keeping everything alive uh so far so
00:07:45.479 the only thing is is I don't this is
00:07:47.000 where like I told him as we was talking
00:07:48.879 about this runic thunder dragon stuff is
00:07:50.479 like this is the confliction I can see
00:07:51.879 is like if you don't get like any access
00:07:53.479 to draw you're just playing runic and at
00:07:54.960 this point you're playing probably the
00:07:56.280 worst runic deck when you could be
00:07:58.240 playing like runic bis steal runic
00:07:59.560 generator or and stuff like that and
00:08:01.759 then arguably you're playing the worst
00:08:03.120 thunder dragon variant too but he's
00:08:04.800 going to go Ahad and attempt to Target
00:08:05.639 the Borger I'm going to go and chain Val
00:08:07.479 Caesar to dodge and this is like
00:08:09.400 something guys like I I'll like go into
00:08:11.000 depth and like The Deck Profile and
00:08:12.120 stuff like that if everyone wants to see
00:08:13.199 like a vanor soul Deck Profile is this
00:08:15.039 is like me my favorite
00:08:18.120 um like mechanic in the game is uh being
00:08:21.680 able to speal tag out special from the
00:08:23.240 hand like Cosmo was like so cool to me
00:08:25.960 like being able to banish and then
00:08:27.400 summon from the hand allowed you to
00:08:28.479 dodge effects and stuff like that that
00:08:30.560 was really like cool and the fact that
00:08:31.919 Valley of Caesar is like probably one of
00:08:33.080 my favorite artworks it like reminds me
00:08:34.440 of that dragon from Elden ring like
00:08:36.719 being able to like tag out and come down
00:08:38.320 and then Valia Caesar like right here
00:08:39.599 I'm training Valia Caesar to the
00:08:40.839 activation of Fountain to destroy one
00:08:42.200 card in the field so I'm going to
00:08:43.479 destroy the fountain something else
00:08:46.200 that's interesting that you can do is
00:08:47.399 you can Val a Caesar and Destroy um your
00:08:50.519 own card so like if they try to like you
00:08:51.680 have Borger and stuff like that and
00:08:52.560 you've already gone through the tagout
00:08:54.320 and they go you a Borger effect to draw
00:08:55.720 they try to imper Borger you can chain
00:08:57.120 Caesar to if you have the attributes of
00:08:58.920 course to destroy the Borger so then
00:09:00.279 Borg's draw resolves or Borg's like burn
00:09:02.519 will resolve like if you're getting
00:09:03.440 close to time but we are now going to go
00:09:05.880 into game number three here and we look
00:09:08.399 we're looking here at a handful of
00:09:10.600 spells we're going to see an activation
00:09:12.600 of a runic spell which God help the
00:09:14.399 glare I think it's runic tip he's seen
00:09:15.839 runic tip quite a
00:09:17.399 bit there it is yep so correct call
00:09:19.920 there uh we're going to grab the runic
00:09:21.839 tip and we're going to activate this one
00:09:23.720 to special
00:09:25.360 summon he's going to special summon the
00:09:27.600 mugan mugan to discard and he has like
00:09:29.880 two other cards in hand so he's going to
00:09:32.120 go ahead and discard to go ahead and uh
00:09:34.760 but I'm going to activate imperm here to
00:09:36.680 answer the mugan but he does hard but we
00:09:38.640 catch this here see he activates the uh
00:09:40.200 runic Fountain like wait a minute Bud
00:09:41.640 wait a
00:09:42.600 minute uh you actually you have to
00:09:44.959 activate a spell you just it's not on
00:09:46.120 Activation so I was like put those three
00:09:47.920 cards back to the top of the deck and
00:09:49.560 then put those three cards you put to
00:09:50.839 the bottom to the bottom and then if you
00:09:52.800 have a spell you can activate it and
00:09:54.399 looking in his hand he I believe he does
00:09:56.760 have a spell like he does like I don't
00:09:58.720 understand yeah so he does oh no he
00:10:01.440 doesn't have a spell he can activate cuz
00:10:02.720 I don't have any
00:10:03.800 monsters okay so he ends up tributing
00:10:05.839 for Hawk here so now he could have
00:10:07.360 technically activate the spell to summon
00:10:08.720 another one so he actually missed out on
00:10:09.920 a draw that he could have he could have
00:10:11.079 actually got a draw here unless he like
00:10:13.720 knew that he wanted to hold that as a
00:10:14.959 disruption
00:10:16.480 maybe but yeah I see the issue he had
00:10:19.399 mugan he had had no monsters to negate
00:10:21.040 so like he couldn't activate the spell
00:10:22.079 to draw so like he just but like now he
00:10:23.880 could but anyway we're going to pot of
00:10:25.720 prosperity and we're going to banish six
00:10:28.920 a prob prosperity in my opinion is kind
00:10:30.560 of wild I think that this card is like
00:10:32.760 too good and I know like some vanish so
00:10:34.399 players have been like moving away from
00:10:35.639 it but I feel like the deck the deck
00:10:37.200 100% lives and breathed by raisin so you
00:10:39.600 need to maximize on all the potential
00:10:41.240 ways you can get there and that's why I
00:10:43.040 thought about playing like a revolution
00:10:44.320 build too with the vrol but like I don't
00:10:48.120 know like Bell you'd have to trade out
00:10:50.560 like Bell for it and Bell's just so high
00:10:53.279 impact that I don't want to like risk it
00:10:54.800 but like the revolution can like lead
00:10:56.360 you into lines to get to power tool and
00:10:58.320 like gets you into like the ability to
00:10:59.959 make red black rose Dragon too which can
00:11:01.680 like Nuke stuff without make St your
00:11:03.200 soul and stuff like that so I don't know
00:11:05.320 it's just going to be like you know time
00:11:06.800 will time will tell I'll keep testing
00:11:08.880 like right now I'm my extra deck is kind
00:11:10.160 of like I have like I said two free
00:11:11.399 cards on my extra deck that I just got
00:11:12.480 to figure out what to
00:11:13.800 put and I truly think I'm going to end
00:11:15.880 up putting black rose in my extra deck
00:11:17.120 just because like you can stake your
00:11:18.240 soul out something normal summon a hand
00:11:19.480 trap and then nuke the board and then
00:11:22.040 normal summon raisin but we're going to
00:11:23.279 go ahead and normal Sun raisin search
00:11:24.880 we're going to go rais and bounce back
00:11:27.360 and then we're going to go ahead and
00:11:31.000 chain Borger he's going to chain that
00:11:32.920 quick play um and actually I I was like
00:11:35.560 go back see like read your cards boys
00:11:36.839 read your cards because I misplayed here
00:11:38.440 my normal summon raisin I can't go to
00:11:39.920 the Borger line because I've already
00:11:40.959 drawn I activate po of prosperity so I
00:11:43.000 can't draw the turn so I got a normal
00:11:44.279 summon go into rock go ahead and attempt
00:11:46.320 to use Rock effect and what I do is like
00:11:47.680 when Mis plays like this happen I play
00:11:49.120 like I don't know what they the card
00:11:50.240 they have in their hand so I'm just you
00:11:52.440 know the probably the best play would be
00:11:53.800 just to leave raisin out there 100%
00:11:55.959 because I have Borger and I have Val of
00:11:57.600 Caesar in hand so like that would be the
00:11:59.480 best play knowing what I know but I like
00:12:01.160 I said I always play when mess ups like
00:12:02.560 this happen
00:12:04.760 um I play as if I don't know what
00:12:07.040 happened because that's how to get the
00:12:08.279 most on
00:12:09.560 honest testing out of it so like even
00:12:12.920 here he could have activated the
00:12:15.800 fountain so just you know novice with
00:12:18.760 the deck and stuff like that so he's
00:12:19.680 going to activate the destruction one
00:12:21.600 which destroys my rock and then he's
00:12:22.880 going to get to put back three it's kind
00:12:24.680 of funny because in a game prior to this
00:12:27.560 um and I could be bet I have crow in my
00:12:29.839 hand so I could be cowling these spells
00:12:31.000 as well but I'm choosing not to keep the
00:12:32.320 so I keep the dark in my hand but I a
00:12:34.639 game prior to this or after this I
00:12:36.240 believe that I opened three three DD
00:12:38.519 crows and my it was like my only
00:12:39.760 namesake was he was getting ready to
00:12:40.800 draw three and I ended up DD crowing all
00:12:42.360 three of his
00:12:43.320 targets but again he's hitting me with
00:12:45.440 another
00:12:46.839 tip just a tip
00:12:52.320 though and then so so this is yeah he's
00:12:56.720 missed a draw quite a few times which is
00:12:58.399 like probably put him put him farther
00:12:59.959 behind than
00:13:01.240 me but he's going to attempt to activate
00:13:03.480 this one I believe destroys the spell
00:13:04.519 and trap which is just imperm I Mill
00:13:06.720 three four excuse me that's crazy that
00:13:08.600 and he activates another one and if he
00:13:11.199 could just get access to I think that's
00:13:12.720 what he's trying to go for he's going to
00:13:13.920 go mugan effect discard mind control to
00:13:15.800 go ahead and grab um the other which I
00:13:19.040 think he should he might have just
00:13:20.839 overextended his resources here but he's
00:13:22.800 on to something with the Kaiju like he
00:13:24.800 wants to like give like his idea is like
00:13:26.360 he's going to Kaiju you mind control the
00:13:27.600 Kaiju and then he'll activate like under
00:13:29.240 dragon dark and then turn the Kaiju into
00:13:30.920 like Colossus so like he's outed a
00:13:32.480 monster and been able to make um
00:13:36.120 Colossus here
00:13:38.639 but yeah he's pretty much
00:13:41.920 um he's now like without anything which
00:13:44.320 is kind of crazy so that's like that's
00:13:45.760 like one of like the things I can you've
00:13:46.920 noticed like with new runic players and
00:13:48.320 stuff like that is sometimes they like
00:13:50.639 overextend and trying to get that draw
00:13:52.680 and they miss calculate the number of
00:13:53.680 spells they have so we're going to draw
00:13:55.639 here for turn and I believe I rip a
00:13:57.680 raisin no rip mad love go ahead and
00:13:59.880 activate mad love or normal summon
00:14:04.320 activate um and that's going to grab me
00:14:06.680 I don't think I have a Target actually I
00:14:08.040 think I actually or maybe I do maybe I
00:14:09.480 grab snow devil okay there's one of
00:14:10.920 these games cuz we did a lot of testing
00:14:12.160 the day that we did this that I actually
00:14:13.279 had no targets cuz he ended up hitting
00:14:14.480 them off of all the runic
00:14:15.959 cards and then I'm going to go ahead and
00:14:17.920 use the mad love to reveal a fire and a
00:14:19.920 earth or a dark and a earth to go ahead
00:14:21.240 and bounce back the monster with the
00:14:22.320 lowest attack go ahead and go Borger
00:14:24.040 here Borger reveal mad love to draw so
00:14:25.480 now now we're on to it we end up drawing
00:14:27.040 I think that was a rise heart so now we
00:14:28.920 have a fire in her hand but we're going
00:14:30.120 to go ahead and Valia Caesar bounce back
00:14:31.680 Borger go Valia Caesar effect to
00:14:34.000 reveal oh did I did I miscalculate I
00:14:36.360 don't think I have
00:14:39.040 um I think I'm missing an attribute I
00:14:41.199 think I'm missing Earth vas was my Earth
00:14:43.680 so I was like great now we're just going
00:14:44.759 to do Valas Valas control I
00:14:47.880 guess and we go ahead and smack into the
00:14:51.199 hawk which means we can now set a card
00:14:54.160 or do we do we dare leak off into rock
00:14:56.000 no valious control is that what we're
00:14:57.519 doing
00:14:59.320 because I think that's this is the
00:15:00.120 correct we can vas we could technically
00:15:01.639 go Borger into or Val we go Borger into
00:15:04.639 vas Borger reveal a dark draw a card if
00:15:07.079 we grip an earth then we can valy s
00:15:08.480 Borger yep so we go
00:15:10.480 here and then he just Scoops it up
00:15:12.399 because there's nothing he can do here
00:15:13.399 we with Borg be able to burn but anyway
00:15:15.160 thank you guys so much for watching this
00:15:16.199 is Charles from team cogg and uh you
