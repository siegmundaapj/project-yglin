00:00:00.760 what's up guys welcome back to the team
00:00:01.920 s circus live video tell the left side
00:00:03.639 here we have branded going up against a
00:00:05.600 pile deck on the right we see a Horus
00:00:09.760 light sworn thunder dragon deck um I
00:00:13.280 might be forgetting something else as
00:00:14.400 well we're going to start off with oh
00:00:15.559 yeah and the bals here we're starting
00:00:17.160 off with the normal summon of a safer
00:00:19.760 and we're going to be activating its
00:00:22.240 effects sending the leion ear from the
00:00:24.720 hand probably searching for a copy of
00:00:26.119 luon here a nice little Bridge we're
00:00:28.119 going act for the lon to search for a
00:00:29.599 copy of a BAL most likely being the
00:00:31.519 Magnum that we are going to be seeing
00:00:32.840 right here you know the safer having
00:00:35.800 like a nice little Bridge they can use
00:00:37.239 in the graveyard as well to add B that L
00:00:38.600 Bellion is pretty nice we're going to
00:00:39.800 see a copy of gold tar activating you
00:00:41.440 know lots of graveyard effects that can
00:00:42.559 activate uh and we're going to be
00:00:44.000 banishing that copy of the dark I think
00:00:47.280 or I believe that's dark I'm not 100%
00:00:51.199 certain on my uh thunder dragon
00:00:54.320 still that could also be Roar it's yeah
00:00:56.840 it's Roar there okay
00:01:00.760 and it's going to AC effect summoning
00:01:02.239 out the dark from the
00:01:08.159 deck and if we get in on Colossus this
00:01:10.520 used to be a deck a little bit back in
00:01:11.880 the day um not including the Thunder
00:01:14.360 including the bisel cards but it did
00:01:16.479 include the uh the Dragon cards still so
00:01:20.479 we going seeing the bals being a new
00:01:23.360 accomplishment um or new addition to the
00:01:25.400 deck we're going to see it summon out
00:01:27.000 the magnumite by banishing the copy
00:01:28.280 leaner then we're going be using the
00:01:29.920 lelion to summon out the copy of itself
00:01:32.040 by tributing off that copy of the magnut
00:01:35.880 and we will activate the effect of be of
00:01:38.640 the lubon putting the regain onto the
00:01:40.759 field we're going to link both of those
00:01:42.399 away into the copy of Ip then IP is
00:01:44.520 going to oh we're going to see the
00:01:46.119 effect of the dark going to activates
00:01:48.640 effects in the graveyard because it was
00:01:49.799 linked away um to search for a copy of
00:01:52.439 Hawk Hawk can actually bring back out
00:01:54.439 the copy which is going to also let us
00:01:56.479 have our access to our uh
00:02:00.159 our um thunder dragon Colossus on the
00:02:03.119 field here we also have regained as well
00:02:05.799 which is pretty nice if we have another
00:02:07.399 bisti on the hand or you know we can
00:02:08.800 always banish that copy of the safer um
00:02:11.840 we're going to be banishing we're going
00:02:13.400 to activate the effect of Hawk using the
00:02:15.640 itself to then or discarding itself
00:02:18.959 activating in the hands to not the copy
00:02:20.400 of Roar and then we're going to activate
00:02:21.920 the effect banishing two for a chaos
00:02:23.920 Creator here um which is very nice and
00:02:26.280 we actually get to activate the effect
00:02:27.480 of regain to put back and then as draw a
00:02:37.760 card but trying to put back that Lev
00:02:40.440 unfortunately cannot so having to put
00:02:41.760 back the hawk instead and then we're
00:02:43.400 going to get overlaying for a copy of
00:02:45.319 the zombie vampire which is going to be
00:02:47.319 able to activate its effects detaching
00:02:48.800 to the mill um we see a Horus solar and
00:02:53.200 then we see a f as well so we can s out
00:02:55.159 the Horus here then activate the effect
00:02:56.440 of Fel or just summon out the F there
00:02:58.560 off the Horus we then then act with the
00:03:00.319 chaos Bas which is a very nice draw to
00:03:01.760 put back the copy of loveer to the deck
00:03:03.360 and then drawing an additional card um
00:03:05.680 there's no really reason to have him
00:03:07.200 steady in the graveyard
00:03:11.000 right we do have an appoa setup if we
00:03:13.840 wanted to but like we could have had a
00:03:15.319 bigger appala or the copy of
00:03:18.360 SP you know they did see I believe a
00:03:20.760 branded card from the opponent in the
00:03:22.480 graveyard there we have a luell on Spain
00:03:24.159 at least they're on Bal cards um so yeah
00:03:27.599 we see okay we do see a Ash and also a
00:03:30.200 copy of fusion deployment um I I guess
00:03:33.480 I'm I'm kind of confused with the ash
00:03:35.319 myself but being confused at Fusion
00:03:37.799 deployment it's not really normal but uh
00:03:41.040 yeah Ash and a Branda deck is uh unless
00:03:42.879 you're playing crosso it's kind of weird
00:03:44.120 that we're seeing the hand traps we're
00:03:45.680 going to be going for a copy of Colossus
00:03:47.519 here and then we get to acate the effect
00:03:49.360 or we get to resolve the effect here of
00:03:51.120 the Magnum during the end phase
00:03:52.439 searching for a copy of a Dru worm
00:03:55.840 here so we see maybe a three mat appoa
00:03:58.840 going to be made using that P the Feliz
00:04:00.720 and the um whatever the zombie vampire
00:04:05.000 they might have gone a world where you
00:04:06.840 actually go for an SP instead being able
00:04:08.920 to banish maybe the normal summon that
00:04:10.360 they have on the field ESP they have
00:04:11.840 like an alaz that they can just normal
00:04:13.159 summon can like threaten the Colossus
00:04:15.799 extremely uh but we see a normal summon
00:04:19.680 of an albz here AC effect discarding the
00:04:22.240 copy of a
00:04:25.520 Luber they're in a
00:04:28.120 chainy why
00:04:32.080 on the new Bellion here that's
00:04:36.680 uh that's interesting to me I feel like
00:04:38.840 we just like if you're worried about
00:04:40.600 branded and red you
00:04:43.120 do I don't know what we're trying to
00:04:45.280 accomplish here we're going to be seeing
00:04:46.680 the
00:04:47.639 uh albas
00:04:49.919 resolve getting rid of the Colossus
00:04:52.360 going for a Mir Jade and like now we're
00:04:55.000 at the point where we have to go into
00:04:56.919 that s we have to go into SP but SP is
00:04:59.400 going to be banished by the M anyways
00:05:03.280 like
00:05:05.039 yeah maybe trying to get that draw off
00:05:08.160 the regained to see what we can
00:05:14.520 get the Brandon player is in a good
00:05:17.600 stance
00:05:21.600 here
00:05:23.280 like yeah cuz we just I the effect of
00:05:25.400 Mir Jade they chain S IP going into
00:05:28.160 something the mirade is going to banish
00:05:30.000 it
00:05:31.639 there I'm going to activate branded
00:05:34.080 Fusion here they're going to attempt the
00:05:36.560 chain IP we're going to chain Mir Jade
00:05:40.039 here that's the problem like you cannot
00:05:42.400 IP when Mir Jades onto the field because
00:05:43.840 it just gets banished anyways there's
00:05:45.560 nothing we can really do to stop it
00:05:48.039 either we're going to send the Titanic
00:05:50.039 clad and we're going to be banishing the
00:05:51.720 copy of
00:05:55.080 Ip and it does not resolve and like now
00:05:57.759 they're just sitting on essentially
00:05:58.800 nothing they do have a and like a bodies
00:06:00.720 on the field uh but there's not much
00:06:02.319 that they can do Regan will be able to
00:06:03.960 Sone back with the copy of Magnum if
00:06:05.440 they need to um or obviously if that l
00:06:07.880 or if that copy of
00:06:11.919 um Drew firm gets to the graveyard we
00:06:14.440 will be able to bring it back out so
00:06:16.880 we're going to be seeing the regain
00:06:18.199 activate on the Alon which can activate
00:06:19.800 effects and we're going to chain regain
00:06:21.080 up the copy of magn which can then
00:06:22.280 activate as well to search and we are
00:06:23.960 Walling up here which is quite efficient
00:06:26.960 um
00:06:27.800 but if we can just get MC puppet will be
00:06:30.440 able to take the game
00:06:33.080 anyways and we do see an Alba lentis in
00:06:37.240 their extra deck I mean when you're
00:06:39.520 playing against tempai it's a really
00:06:41.319 good card I think that card is going to
00:06:42.479 be used a little bit more now especially
00:06:44.440 as like a tech option we're going to be
00:06:46.360 seeing the albas and the Aquarius or the
00:06:49.520 albas and the Uber for Aquarius there
00:06:52.120 which can kind of like force everything
00:06:53.599 to zero which is kind of important like
00:06:55.560 you know when you have to beat over a
00:06:56.680 bunch of stuff being able to force
00:06:57.919 everything to zero is pretty nice we
00:06:59.840 send the Titanic Cloud to the graveyard
00:07:01.080 so we will be able to actually either
00:07:03.000 summon not the copy of quem during the
00:07:05.240 end phase then also dump like copy of
00:07:07.520 cesia which can then add itself back if
00:07:09.960 we have go for a branded and red line or
00:07:11.759 we can just leave in the graveyard as
00:07:12.879 well we're going to be treating off that
00:07:14.440 copy of lubell on here uh we're going to
00:07:18.479 trting out the Alan for the lelion and
00:07:20.280 we have the cesia in the hand already to
00:07:22.000 special summon itself out having that
00:07:24.120 going to be able to also search for the
00:07:25.560 Lost is insanely huge this hand's like
00:07:28.680 kind of like free what the heck I'm
00:07:31.280 seeing this hand this hand was branded
00:07:33.639 Fusion albas Al Luber
00:07:38.919 cesia you don't really know the other
00:07:40.720 car
00:07:42.720 is that's
00:07:48.400 crazy and then we're going to be
00:07:50.319 searching for a sprin kit and then we're
00:07:52.680 going to be dumping the adlib off of the
00:07:55.400 ganol here um this is actually going to
00:07:57.440 let us also we also see
00:08:01.360 can speci himself out which is pretty
00:08:02.720 nice going search for that copy of
00:08:03.960 branded and red essentially getting that
00:08:05.879 Guardian chimra
00:08:09.319 access I'm we going to put one back to
00:08:11.720 the bottom of the deck
00:08:14.800 here being a MCC Courier and a opening
00:08:19.479 like had opening as well that's that's
00:08:24.840 nice you see the Branded in red here the
00:08:28.840 Met world where we actually activate the
00:08:30.479 quitus first make everything zero and
00:08:32.240 then s with the kit they're going go
00:08:34.000 battle phase attack into
00:08:41.240 it then attack and attack most likely
00:08:46.519 leaving that's what they did do okay so
00:08:48.760 they did do quitus first um and then
00:08:51.240 they summon up the kit but now we're
00:08:53.760 going to be seeing the effect of the drw
00:08:57.279 going to be activating we do have the
00:08:58.360 mcer in the hand
00:09:08.519 but they're going to let that go I mean
00:09:10.120 they're summoning qu during the end
00:09:11.279 phase anyways it makes zero difference
00:09:13.279 for them to uh to negate
00:09:15.880 that we do go branded and red here with
00:09:18.480 the ad
00:09:22.040 libitum they're going to add back and
00:09:24.040 then we could Fusion summon using the
00:09:25.880 itself and the kit to go for maybe a
00:09:28.839 copy of M grade and we do see the Mas
00:09:31.079 grade here so probably not playing the
00:09:33.040 sanctifier ad some with the copy of Mir
00:09:35.160 Jade and we're just going to attack we
00:09:39.120 can't attack directly with that copy of
00:09:41.519 the Masquerade but we can't attack
00:09:43.800 directly with that copy of Mir Jade
00:09:48.920 though then end phase we're going to be
00:09:51.480 seeing
00:09:53.800 the uh Titanic clad adding the quem to
00:09:58.560 hand and setting the copy of Retribution
00:10:01.600 I feel we should have definitely
00:10:02.480 summoned itself out
00:10:05.760 there instead of adding it to the
00:10:10.680 hand but like retribution is like super
00:10:13.160 crazy
00:10:23.800 still yeah if we added the qu we summon
00:10:27.200 quem to the field qu can activate effect
00:10:28.720 definitely like
00:10:29.959 we already have the ALB in the graveyard
00:10:34.040 but I probably don't play too Brandon
00:10:36.600 and reds
00:10:39.920 either maybe dump
00:10:43.480 it yeah there's no real line there but
00:10:45.920 we did take a bunch of
00:10:48.040 damage whenever they activate stuff they
00:10:50.200 will be hitting it with masquerade
00:11:09.959 but yeah we also have the copy of uh
00:11:13.760 like retribution being in the OR
00:11:15.839 retribution able to put back Titanic
00:11:17.200 clad in the Uber uh the the albon and
00:11:21.440 also having the surprise copy of uh
00:11:24.320 mccarrier in the hand is kind of crazy
00:11:33.200 and they're asking what the effects do
00:11:34.480 you know if Mir Jade leaves the field
00:11:36.680 it's not going to be destroy everything
00:11:37.680 we do see the qcr being slapped down
00:11:44.880 there but they're just going to go next
00:11:46.959 they realize that they are going to lose
00:11:48.360 the game you know qu just being able to
00:11:50.160 turn everything down to zero and then if
00:11:51.560 they start activating effects taking
00:11:53.000 damage is just not going to be enough um
00:11:55.839 brand is such a deck that like you can
00:11:57.519 just play for so long um and like still
00:12:00.279 discover new lines or still just find
00:12:01.600 like different ways of like we seeing
00:12:02.880 when you play against random stuff like
00:12:04.440 this like granted it's not really random
00:12:07.600 but like it's not necessarily meta so
00:12:10.720 being able to like just adapt and some
00:12:13.199 them summon it like I don't know why we
00:12:14.480 added the Crum of the hand maybe we
00:12:16.000 didn't feel like there was any good
00:12:17.040 Reborns off the quam and it just makes
00:12:18.959 it a better normal summon or if they get
00:12:21.839 if it gets lost during next turn like
00:12:24.240 you know if we end up getting like hit
00:12:25.399 with a copy of uh like R here or some
00:12:28.760 random stuff like that um then having
00:12:31.199 the normal summon of a quem cuz I assume
00:12:32.880 they don't have any of good normals in
00:12:34.079 the hand definitely helps you out
00:12:36.199 significantly um but at that point it's
00:12:39.079 just like well we would be able to add
00:12:40.440 bad add back branded and red
00:12:44.279 uh with our copy of uh or even adding
00:12:48.320 back a branded fusion with our copy of
00:12:50.880 uh retribution that we already had set
00:12:53.240 um you kind of debate well if they
00:12:55.440 didn't set branded retribution they're
00:12:57.160 probably well if they set Brandon
00:12:58.639 retribution they're probably not on two
00:13:00.079 branded and reds uh or else quen would
00:13:02.519 have been special out dumping the
00:13:03.560 retribution so they had it anyways but
00:13:07.279 uh we'll be diving onto game three I
00:13:09.760 feel like if they would have had a
00:13:11.160 second retribution or second copy brand
00:13:13.440 they would have set it U because we
00:13:15.440 would have probably gone for that copy
00:13:17.600 of uh
00:13:20.560 Chimera but at the same time it's like
00:13:22.519 the bals really hurt them a lot but
00:13:24.880 we're going to be seeing Brandon being
00:13:26.839 forced to go first here starting off
00:13:29.240 with a branded opening discarding a copy
00:13:31.399 of branded Fusion searching for a High
00:13:35.199 Spirits or searching for yeah summ up
00:13:39.160 the Uber here Alber is going to be
00:13:40.440 searching for High Spirits is what I'm
00:13:41.680 trying to say there so maybe already
00:13:43.480 having a copy of branded Fusion in the
00:13:49.399 hand yeah we do see a second copy of
00:13:51.519 brand Fusion we're going to activate
00:13:53.079 brand High Spirit sending the
00:13:55.519 albas and this card is always probably
00:13:58.360 the most complicated Brand C that we
00:13:59.959 have so it's reveal one monster from
00:14:02.240 your hand and the same S one level eight
00:14:04.639 monster was going to be the copy of
00:14:05.800 Titanic clad which can some El the quem
00:14:07.680 during the end phase
00:14:10.920 here and then we can send the albas to
00:14:13.639 to search for the cesia here which is
00:14:15.199 very crazy cuz then cesia can actually
00:14:16.759 summon herself out cuz now the alaz is
00:14:18.839 in the graveyard it also set up branded
00:14:20.120 in red if we have it as well um this
00:14:22.199 being like an overall nice card like it
00:14:23.680 is 8 minus one but you do uh get to
00:14:26.160 search for really
00:14:27.880 whatever so CIA special out of the
00:14:30.360 heresia so now we can just dodge imperm
00:14:32.480 whenever we want to and we activate the
00:14:33.839 brandage fusion right away and be able
00:14:36.440 to start sending which is
00:14:52.959 crazy sending L Bellion and albas
00:14:56.320 here going for a copy of the AL on Alon
00:14:59.600 can AC F effects using the albas as well
00:15:02.399 as the AL the Uber if we want
00:15:05.320 to we don't really want to discard a
00:15:07.600 card
00:15:15.480 though and we're going to chain
00:15:20.680 cesia to go for that gonal so choosing
00:15:23.680 not to go for the Branded lost lineup um
00:15:27.639 just wanting to make sure that we have
00:15:28.759 that
00:15:36.360 IAL we could have done it on the albon
00:15:39.800 there I feel like we should have done it
00:15:40.800 on the albon uh
00:15:45.040 personally like we should have waited
00:15:46.800 for lalion because L can use
00:15:54.639 itself it doesn't really matter I
00:15:56.959 suppose though
00:15:59.800 because regardless you're still getting
00:16:02.480 the Alon you're still getting a Luber on
00:16:04.880 the field uh the lalion being used in ad
00:16:08.480 lib in the
00:16:10.160 graveyard um but like now you just don't
00:16:12.480 have essentially your uh any like
00:16:16.040 targets for
00:16:17.839 lost which is fine because we do have
00:16:19.800 the Titanic loud summon with the copy of
00:16:21.600 the quem here which we are setting
00:16:23.519 branded in red as
00:16:25.240 well and then Titanic will be able to
00:16:27.519 activate to summon out that cop copy of
00:16:33.759 quen which can then
00:16:37.720 dump most likely retribution I feel
00:16:43.880 like or a cesia cesia would add back we
00:16:48.279 might have taken out retribution from
00:16:49.639 our deck thinking that we wouldn't be
00:16:50.920 going
00:16:56.440 first and just passing on this so we do
00:16:59.120 the Branded and red setup uh we also
00:17:01.880 have the um double mirr Jade send uh so
00:17:06.319 we're going to be spending a friend
00:17:07.439 mirror here which is kind of unfortunate
00:17:10.559 we might just activate mirror Jade on
00:17:14.959 this yeah before we get anything sending
00:17:17.240 the copy of R brm there because we do
00:17:18.599 have the albas and the grave red as well
00:17:20.880 so we'll be able to uh to summon out
00:17:23.839 that if we do get interrupted later
00:17:25.640 we're going to be seeing the horse
00:17:27.039 activating sending the copy of I believe
00:17:28.559 it's polias searching for kinger
00:17:34.120 here and like we do have either the pop
00:17:36.600 or the the pop one or pop two setup here
00:17:40.160 cuz we do have that K cesia in the
00:17:44.039 hand then they're going to dark roller
00:17:46.120 the field but it's not going to matter
00:17:48.440 very much all that dark Ru is going to
00:17:50.400 do is stop that copy of grol alongside
00:17:52.520 the copy of quam we're going to add the
00:17:54.799 dragon Ling here which is a crazy card
00:17:59.080 now that triple
00:18:03.520 effects like talk about a custom card if
00:18:05.760 that c would have came out like 3 years
00:18:08.320 or even two years ago that c been just
00:18:10.679 busted um and then we're to like custom
00:18:14.200 send sending the copy of Fel summon
00:18:15.960 itself out then we can just Synchro away
00:18:18.280 into our copy of the manura
00:18:23.640 Synchro you know some of the new light
00:18:25.640 sworn stuff lightsworn Bisal is pretty
00:18:28.320 nice
00:18:29.280 I guess just a light sorn dot
00:18:32.000 deck I don't even know what you'd call
00:18:33.960 this
00:18:35.159 deck the
00:18:41.360 pile then we search for a punishment
00:18:51.360 Dragon then we send the
00:18:54.679 wolf the way withs
00:19:09.480 to the graveyard here
00:19:16.280 okay and then we're going to activate to
00:19:18.799 summon itself out we also add one to the
00:19:22.120 hand
00:19:26.000 here and like do we flip up Brandon red
00:19:29.000 here popping those two knowing they have
00:19:30.799 also the king star in the hand uh we're
00:19:33.000 going to add back the ad libitum and
00:19:34.720 then we're going to be able to
00:19:37.480 use the adlib Paul or adlib Lu Bellion
00:19:41.960 and then the miror Jade to go for that
00:19:44.360 copy of the Gran Chima here we're going
00:19:46.640 to see gradian Chima lost gradian Chima
00:19:49.159 as well as the ad lib to uh to add back
00:19:52.120 or some out that copy of miror jade
00:20:00.840 I'm get to search for that copy of the
00:20:02.400 mccu so also having a follow-up monster
00:20:04.600 negate is pretty or yeah monster negate
00:20:06.760 is pretty
00:20:09.799 nice then we draw one being a cob the
00:20:13.080 grave here and popping both those cards
00:20:15.480 uh is very
00:20:18.919 nice we do see the regain being
00:20:21.320 activated here and then we're activating
00:20:22.520 the gold the king Stark now if we would
00:20:24.640 have been able to pop these two cards
00:20:25.919 that would have been
00:20:27.640 crazy then we see King star effects
00:20:29.919 going to be activating I don't believe
00:20:31.120 we have anything other than the insetti
00:20:33.200 in the graveyard
00:20:34.640 here we're going to be sending the copy
00:20:36.880 of the Roar to the graveyard to be able
00:20:41.080 to search for the
00:20:43.840 happy I guess yeah dumps happy there but
00:20:46.600 whatever you guys know what I mean they
00:20:48.600 want to see the happy being summoned out
00:20:50.320 there
00:20:51.840 by the king star course inherit summons
00:20:55.159 same thing with the Mady and we're going
00:20:56.720 to try to go for a zombie vampire at
00:20:59.039 this
00:21:03.679 point but we could
00:21:11.679 just Mir Jade get rid of it and mean
00:21:16.360 they do have one more card in the hand
00:21:17.799 so chances are they could do another
00:21:20.640 horse but would they even
00:21:33.159 going try to go battle phase but we're
00:21:34.799 going to go Ren brm effect summon out
00:21:38.039 activating the effect
00:21:42.320 send the called
00:21:46.159 by to use itself plus the M
00:21:53.120 steady surely you can still fuse with
00:21:55.600 them
00:22:01.880 going for lelion lellan can activate
00:22:03.600 effects discarding the copy of cesia
00:22:05.919 which is just going to add back anyways
00:22:08.000 then we're going to put back two fusion
00:22:09.480 monsters to go for the copy of the
00:22:12.919 Boral which can
00:22:25.000 pop they just scoop it up realize that
00:22:27.320 they know they have lost lost uh yeah if
00:22:30.360 they if the Horus cards activated the
00:22:32.640 graveyard they would have gotten hit
00:22:33.640 with the copy MCC there's not much they
00:22:35.159 can do there even like Boral Fury is
00:22:38.480 just nice being able to start popping
00:22:39.679 the stuff hitting the regained they
00:22:41.279 didn't have any bols in hand as well
00:22:42.640 they you know we saw heavier lights SW
00:22:44.080 and stuff there uh so we see Brandon end
00:22:45.960 up taking it 20 here just being able to
00:22:47.880 flood the boards better than the
00:22:49.080 flooding dot deck uh you know kind of
00:22:52.120 making them go first we didn't see any
00:22:53.919 ging cupets there I don't think they're
