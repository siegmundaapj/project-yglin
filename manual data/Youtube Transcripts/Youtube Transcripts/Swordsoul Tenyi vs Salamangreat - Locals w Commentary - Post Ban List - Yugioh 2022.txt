00:00:17.199 tennie

00:00:23.119 hauck i'm gonna call it sword soul
00:00:24.880 hackbot that's what it is so yep so this
00:00:27.439 should be an interesting match not often

00:00:30.400 the channel so we're excited to do that
00:00:31.920 for you today i'm excited to commentate

00:01:06.080 without further ado we are gonna see
00:01:09.439 i think shane win the deck pro the dice
00:01:11.439 roll and we're gonna dive on in to this
00:01:13.360 live duel
00:01:14.930 [Music]
00:01:18.640 card
00:01:21.930 [Music]
00:01:24.799 all right starting things off i do
00:01:26.159 realize that we need to fix our camera a
00:01:28.159 little bit we can't see the top side of
00:01:30.000 the screen but we'll get on that we do
00:01:31.520 see a lightning storm and in perm in
00:01:33.920 ben's hand that's gonna be really nice
00:01:35.520 going in storage so that's gonna crush
00:01:36.880 him actually but shane opens up with an
00:01:38.640 ecclesia he's gonna use ecclesia's
00:01:40.159 effects to tribute herself and that's
00:01:42.079 gonna special summon a sword soul
00:01:43.840 monster from his deck usually goes for
00:01:45.360 the mo yi and then he reveals another
00:01:47.840 moyi in hand to then bring out a token
00:01:51.119 those two are gonna make your grand
00:01:52.960 master and then what happens when you
00:01:54.799 make grandmasters actually and say oh
00:01:56.399 that's a droll so we got shane main deck
00:01:58.479 and droll at the locals that is
00:02:00.960 that is some stuff that he would do
00:02:02.479 right there so uh we're gonna see
00:02:04.320 grandmaster come down grand master is
00:02:06.640 effect is it lets you add a sword soul
00:02:08.878 card from your deck to your hand and
00:02:10.639 moyi when it's used as a synchro summon
00:02:12.720 allows you to draw and that's how you
00:02:14.239 chain block the grand master
00:02:16.319 um
00:02:17.280 i see ben thinking he does have an
00:02:18.800 imperm is this something that you want
00:02:19.840 to improve probably not because his next
00:02:21.760 move is going to go for the long you won
00:02:23.920 and what you can do is when you go for
00:02:25.280 the long you won they bring out baron
00:02:26.879 you just start with an imperm on the
00:02:28.480 baron the grandmaster is already intact
00:02:30.720 so you have grand master and you have
00:02:32.800 baron they're both going to be an attack
00:02:35.040 because nobody's playing around
00:02:35.920 lightning storm right now and especially
00:02:37.360 with baron's the difference between
00:02:39.040 attack and defense most people put baron
00:02:40.879 in attack so you just imprint baron drop
00:02:43.760 lightning storm wipe that if he has
00:02:45.519 blackout it turns it off because he has
00:02:47.200 no worm on the field boom you just go
00:02:49.120 for the kill there so
00:02:50.640 uh crazy what we're about to see here so
00:02:52.400 we're gonna see him add the longy one
00:02:54.720 and we're gonna long you one pitch and i
00:02:56.560 did not see what he pitched because we
00:02:57.920 again we cut off the top of the screen
00:02:59.200 so we will work on that i know with my
00:03:00.879 duel with ben i've adjusted that and i
00:03:02.480 noticed that but um i know how this door
00:03:04.959 went so i had to commentate this but
00:03:06.480 we're going to go ahead and see the long
00:03:07.440 u1
00:03:08.640 synchro with the token and that's going
00:03:10.480 to go into a baron and we're going to
00:03:12.159 get the long u1 effect to burn for 12
00:03:14.080 which is insane that's how it helps with
00:03:15.680 the otk
00:03:17.440 so look at that
00:03:18.720 way to play into lightning storms right
00:03:20.640 here in perm lightning storm
00:03:22.959 that is it's about to come down it's
00:03:24.879 about to get hit i can't wait to see it
00:03:27.360 so we set one we don't know what it is
00:03:30.080 uh i think i oh there it is a blackout
00:03:32.319 so we do know that that top card is
00:03:33.680 blackout whether it be imperm or drop it
00:03:35.519 whatever be but the blackout is
00:03:36.959 completely turned off to an in-perm
00:03:38.480 lightning storm here it comes get ready
00:03:40.239 i see an ash i think he topped like an
00:03:41.760 ash there uh here it comes here it comes
00:03:44.640 let's see it
00:03:47.519 all right
00:03:51.120 imperman on the baron
00:03:53.200 it resolves
00:03:54.560 drop it oh
00:03:55.920 the gold there it is the lightning storm
00:04:00.000 wipe it off turn off the blackout go for
00:04:03.120 the game go for game all right let's see
00:04:05.120 he's got he's going to go ahead and go
00:04:06.159 for the jack jaguar here
00:04:10.080 shane's got to read it's not a good sign
00:04:14.000 so we go for the jack jaguar i see
00:04:16.238 spinny in hand
00:04:20.639 let's see what ben decides to do here
00:04:23.600 he's gonna go ahead and spin eat this
00:04:25.280 card
00:04:32.080 and then he's going to go ahead and link
00:04:33.600 off the jack jaguar go for the bailings
00:04:38.160 and then we're going to go ahead and get
00:04:39.120 the bailinx effect to search for the
00:04:40.880 sanctuary
00:04:47.199 so if all this resolves because like i
00:04:48.960 said he had blackout we don't know what
00:04:50.400 the other set is but i think i saw that
00:04:51.840 it was a spell it might have been a
00:04:53.040 sword soul spell i'm not 100 sure there
00:04:55.280 but we are going to see ben get the
00:04:57.120 sanctuary and he is going to activate it
00:04:59.280 i do think that this gets cut off the
00:05:00.560 screen so you have to remember that the
00:05:01.759 sanctuary is there
00:05:03.360 like i said we are going to work on
00:05:04.479 fixing that and correcting that also
00:05:06.720 comment down below let me know if you
00:05:07.840 guys enjoy these locals live duels
00:05:09.520 commentating um truly appreciate if you
00:05:11.600 just comment let me know what your
00:05:12.880 thoughts are because if you're not
00:05:14.479 enjoying them i won't keep posting them
00:05:15.759 but if you are i'll keep working on them
00:05:17.520 so we're gonna get this sanctuary
00:05:20.080 it's that's gonna allow him to use the
00:05:21.759 bailings to go into
00:05:24.080 another bay links
00:05:26.639 and now are we going to see the mirage
00:05:27.759 stalio come out
00:05:30.800 so we are going to get the jack jaguar
00:05:33.280 summoned back
00:05:36.400 by shuffling in the uh bathing suit he's
00:05:38.880 gonna get the spinny spinny's gonna go
00:05:41.120 ahead and summon himself back
00:05:46.880 and then we're gonna see him overlay for
00:05:48.479 oh actually he's gonna go for the link
00:05:50.000 here he's gonna go for the link i think
00:05:51.360 he's gonna climb
00:05:52.639 we're gonna go for the update jammer
00:05:55.680 and if shane's got nothing to stop this
00:05:57.360 we're gonna go update jammer and
00:05:58.560 bailings into transcode oh no transcode
00:06:01.600 bring back update jammer is this how
00:06:03.120 this is gonna end
00:06:04.720 let's see
00:06:06.720 so transcode it does he have an
00:06:08.639 impermeable droplet what's that an
00:06:10.080 impermanent droplet set if it is this is
00:06:12.000 the time to use it shane
00:06:14.880 if you have the m perm or droplet use it
00:06:16.880 here do not let update jammer come back
00:06:18.720 and it was a chalice so i did see it was
00:06:21.520 a spell he's gonna chalice the transcode
00:06:24.400 talker but it does give it 400 that's
00:06:26.240 gonna put 2700 attack i do believe cause
00:06:28.319 i think it's at 2300 adds the 400 from
00:06:30.880 chalice that actually just saved him
00:06:33.199 from getting otk just now i'm gonna be
00:06:35.039 honest because transcode plus update
00:06:36.960 goes into access code which is a 5300
00:06:39.520 attack boss monster that attacks twice
00:06:42.479 so
00:06:45.199 he only gets the 2700 damage in there
00:06:47.919 and
00:06:50.160 let's see what he decides to do
00:06:53.520 i think he i think he uh passed over to
00:06:56.080 shane drew
00:07:00.160 they're going over damage right now so
00:07:01.520 they're talking about how much damage
00:07:02.639 each one of them have taken so
00:07:05.759 ben has taken 12 and shane has taken 27.
00:07:10.400 and let's see what uh shane decides to
00:07:11.919 do here
00:07:12.960 he's going to go ahead and vishuda
00:07:15.759 shooter oh this is just if you could if
00:07:18.080 you open he must have top deck for
00:07:19.680 shooter that is insane now he can link
00:07:21.520 that off for the link one the monk tenye
00:07:23.919 and then
00:07:25.840 he can go ahead and vishuda bounce
00:07:27.520 transcode however however i don't know
00:07:30.880 if that's a smart place who's gonna
00:07:32.080 normal summon ecclesia he's gonna
00:07:34.080 activate ecclesia effect and that gets
00:07:35.440 met with an ash now he has to vishuda as
00:07:37.759 what i was about to say is do you ever
00:07:39.440 shoot a bounce transcode because what's
00:07:41.360 the chances that they play another
00:07:42.479 transcode
00:07:43.520 might be pretty good but that's just not
00:07:46.000 something that you want in the extra
00:07:47.599 deck so
00:07:50.800 he is gonna go ahead and bounce the
00:07:52.240 transcode and then he's gonna swing with
00:07:54.000 monk for a thousand i guess you do
00:07:56.720 because then you can just transcode use
00:07:58.479 the effect i don't know if transcode is
00:08:00.800 on summon or if it's act i think it's
00:08:02.400 activated so actually you could just use
00:08:03.759 transcode next turn so you do have to
00:08:05.759 bounce out with fasciuda but this is not
00:08:07.599 in a good position for shane i mean he's
00:08:09.440 been met with an ash he's been met with
00:08:11.199 the imperm lightning storm he's had like
00:08:13.120 overcome a lot here we know that the
00:08:14.879 blackout is actually active now so
00:08:17.120 that's something to note
00:08:19.039 prior the blackout was not active but
00:08:21.360 now he does have a warm on the field so
00:08:23.120 if ben commits two cards on the field he
00:08:25.440 could flip black out targeting his own
00:08:27.599 monk into there he is so he is actually
00:08:30.080 gonna target the sanctuary that we can't
00:08:32.159 see
00:08:32.958 and um blackout is gonna resolve then
00:08:35.039 he's gonna go ahead and activate
00:08:35.919 bailings to protect his
00:08:38.839 um uh solomon great there
00:08:42.719 so now he's gonna go ahead and activate
00:08:44.000 spinny spinny's gonna bring himself back
00:08:49.120 that was that was crazy so maybe
00:08:52.399 i don't know shane he did get rid of the
00:08:54.240 sanctuary which is pretty good so
00:08:55.839 sanctuary does allow them to link over
00:08:57.440 but now he could just go straight into a
00:08:58.880 sunlight wolf
00:09:02.399 so i use spinney
00:09:04.880 i believe we're gonna see a sunlight
00:09:06.160 wolf come down okay we're gonna go with
00:09:07.680 the bailings
00:09:10.160 i'm not exactly sure what happened there
00:09:11.440 with spinning while i got banished but
00:09:12.560 then jack jack wire is gonna come back
00:09:14.320 we're gonna see them both drop into a
00:09:16.320 splash mage he is gonna go splash mage
00:09:18.959 bring back the update jammer no splash
00:09:21.519 page
00:09:22.399 cannot do that so we're gonna see him
00:09:24.080 bring back the jack jaguar then that's
00:09:26.000 gonna go into the transcode talker and
00:09:28.000 then we're gonna see the transcode
00:09:29.440 talker come down bring back the update
00:09:31.440 jammer those two make access code access
00:09:34.240 code gain attack and that is going to be
00:09:37.200 game one going to solomon greats going
00:09:40.160 second against sword soul hulkbot and
00:09:42.959 salomon greats do take it down great
00:09:45.839 game one in perm lightning storm too
00:09:48.240 strong so you'd love to see it all right
00:09:51.360 game one is over let's let them side and
00:09:53.440 let's go on into game two
00:09:56.160 all right going on in game two just a
00:09:57.760 reminder please make sure to like this
00:10:00.320 uh video and also to subscribe to the
00:10:02.480 channel like i said we are trying to hit
00:10:04.000 2000 by the end of the month so your
00:10:05.839 support does mean a lot now let's dive
00:10:07.920 in to game two we're going to see
00:10:09.360 sorcerer hulkbach go first and we're
00:10:11.519 going to be able to see what they're
00:10:12.640 able to combo off with and uh let's see
00:10:15.040 if he can get some full combo usually
00:10:16.399 the really consistent deck i think i do
00:10:18.000 see two vascular though that's not good
00:10:19.760 so uh he can actually shoot it actually
00:10:22.320 it's not terrible if you can get along
00:10:23.920 you want access then you can pitch the
00:10:25.839 other of a shooter and have
00:10:28.240 set up you get the ashuna can add itself
00:10:31.279 back so
00:10:32.959 it is some there's some place so he does
00:10:34.880 open up with a vessel as well uh so he's
00:10:37.360 gonna go special summon vashuda link
00:10:39.440 that off for the monk then he's gonna
00:10:41.040 activate vessel vessel's gonna allow him
00:10:43.279 to send a tiny monster to the um or a
00:10:46.480 worm actually my apologies to the grave
00:10:48.720 and then he'll be able to add a worm or
00:10:50.959 a
00:10:52.240 tiny oh no shane bricked oh no he's
00:10:55.360 gonna go ahead and he got ash on the
00:10:57.519 vessel so it
00:11:00.320 there we go see i look i told you i i
00:11:01.920 told you i fixed the camera angle so
00:11:05.040 oh we're gonna see the ash on the vessel
00:11:07.360 and then we're gonna see the kaiju on
00:11:08.480 the monk so if that back row is a
00:11:10.240 blackout then now is completely turned
00:11:12.640 off thanks to the kaiju so that kaiju is
00:11:14.720 insane but we do see foxy coming out
00:11:18.560 um
00:11:20.399 man that's crazy i if that was a
00:11:22.320 blackout that's insane so we're gonna
00:11:23.920 see heavenly prison come out
00:11:26.880 that's going to protect his back row and
00:11:28.399 he's going to set one
00:11:30.160 and he's going to go ahead and link that
00:11:31.519 all foxy off for a bailing
00:11:33.680 bailing effect is going to go ahead and
00:11:35.040 add he's going to ash that so now we're
00:11:37.760 going to go ahead and pass to shane
00:11:39.519 shane's going to go ahead and draw
00:11:41.680 so we're gonna see if shane's gonna get
00:11:42.720 himself out of here he does have a
00:11:44.079 vashuda but he does not have the monk
00:11:46.160 access that is the problem so if he
00:11:47.680 doesn't have anything to summon here he
00:11:49.360 cannot use vashuda and grave because the
00:11:51.200 darling just completely cut off that
00:11:52.800 whole engine for him that could darla
00:11:54.880 actually clutch uh we don't know what
00:11:56.800 the back row is but keep in mind that
00:11:58.000 the back row is protected by heavenly
00:11:59.760 prison and if either one of these guys
00:12:02.000 activates their set card he can now
00:12:03.680 summon heavenly prison which is a 3 000
00:12:06.079 attack 3 000 defense body
00:12:08.880 uh he's gonna go battle with a good
00:12:10.639 darla good dollar is gonna hit into
00:12:12.079 bailings he's gonna take that damage
00:12:15.839 i think i see despot in shane's hands so
00:12:17.839 we are gonna see the brick in shane's
00:12:19.839 hand we do know the other cards of a
00:12:20.959 shooter so shoot at despot he could
00:12:22.880 normal some i was going to say normal
00:12:24.160 summon despot turn both those into a
00:12:26.240 haukey fibrax
00:12:29.120 and then he could but then what does he
00:12:30.800 bring out he has nothing he has no play
00:12:32.399 after that because
00:12:33.600 i don't think he i guess he could bring
00:12:35.200 out a tuner
00:12:36.959 but then he can't go aurora dog because
00:12:38.480 aurora needs two machines and we're
00:12:39.920 gonna see a torrential oh no
00:12:42.800 torrential getting rid of the despot now
00:12:44.560 he's gonna be able to summon heavenly
00:12:45.839 prison and he can actually set any spell
00:12:48.320 or trap card from his deck to his
00:12:51.519 this is he's gonna set circle isn't he
00:12:54.000 he's setting circle let's go
00:12:57.120 okay so we're gonna see circle gets set
00:13:00.160 that's absolutely insane to see heavenly
00:13:02.240 prison go into circle to give that
00:13:03.920 access for the salomon great players
00:13:05.680 that is insane so is it trapped solomon
00:13:08.000 great now that's kind of crazy but we're
00:13:09.440 going to see shane go with the vashuda
00:13:10.959 he's going to go ahead and special
00:13:12.079 summon the vashuda
00:13:15.279 and then he's going to go ahead and link
00:13:16.320 up the vashuda to go for the monk
00:13:20.079 and then we're gonna see him he could
00:13:21.920 activate the shooter bounce there's
00:13:24.160 nothing to really bounce he could bounce
00:13:25.519 the back row which is the circle he just
00:13:27.600 activates the next turn anyway so really
00:13:29.519 there's nothing to bounce here he
00:13:30.959 doesn't want to bounce to heavenly
00:13:31.920 prison unless he wants to get rid of the
00:13:33.279 3k body but you do not want to give him
00:13:35.200 access to another set the following turn
00:13:37.519 he just reveals it and he could actually
00:13:39.360 flip circle summon heavenly prison
00:13:41.120 anyway literally does nothing so save
00:13:43.920 the vashuda
00:13:45.519 and let's see what he decides to do he
00:13:46.639 does have one set and we're gonna see
00:13:48.399 what that is he's gonna go ahead and
00:13:49.440 flip over the blackout blackout's gonna
00:13:51.040 go ahead and pop the circle heavenly
00:13:53.440 prison and his tenu that was insane
00:13:56.720 you have to love to see that so
00:13:58.880 it's a pretty much an open board game
00:14:00.720 here open game state i'm sorry um let's
00:14:03.519 see what the salomon great player
00:14:04.800 decides to do as it gets passed to him
00:14:08.160 uh we're gonna see him go ahead and
00:14:09.600 ladybug lady debug
00:14:11.760 so now he can use the effect of lady
00:14:13.440 debug that's gonna go ahead and search
00:14:15.120 he grabs the um gazelle
00:14:20.800 we see shane checking his text messages
00:14:23.040 now so he knows that this game is just
00:14:25.120 all for nothing but we're gonna see here
00:14:26.639 we're gonna go for our bailings linking
00:14:28.720 off and that's going to go ahead and
00:14:30.160 grab the sanctuary the the all the
00:14:32.399 sanctuary coming right back so we're
00:14:34.560 going to see him link the bay links off
00:14:36.160 to go for another bay links
00:14:39.120 and then that's going to trigger the
00:14:40.639 jack jaguar that's going to go ahead or
00:14:42.560 not jack jaguar but the um gazelle
00:14:45.440 then he's gonna send the spinny to the
00:14:47.120 graveyard
00:14:48.639 and then he's gonna spin the effect
00:14:50.480 bring back and he's gonna take those two
00:14:52.560 oh no it's happening he's gonna go into
00:14:54.240 the update jammer turned update jammer
00:14:56.079 and bailings into a transcode talker

00:15:03.199 to see salomon great take it down 2-0
