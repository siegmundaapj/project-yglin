00:00:00.640 what's up guys welcome back to the team
00:00:01.920 s cus live video turn on the left side
00:00:03.800 here we have newly Unleashed melodus uh
00:00:06.839 you know one of the newer decks from the
00:00:09.200 latest set and on the right side here we
00:00:10.960 have Labyrinth an Old Reliable trap deck
00:00:13.000 we're going to be seeing melodus going
00:00:14.080 be choosing to go first here and we're
00:00:15.559 going to be seeing a aado being
00:00:17.680 activated probably a card I see hitting
00:00:20.000 on the band list to be honest this
00:00:21.480 card's absolutely crazy you know having
00:00:23.039 different variations you can play this
00:00:24.240 as an engine you can play this as a deck
00:00:26.359 um and even this card lets us go to
00:00:28.840 different combos we're going to be
00:00:29.759 seeing
00:00:30.560 a soprano alongside the refrain and then
00:00:32.558 we're seeing a baka being summoned we're
00:00:34.440 going to be activating the effect of the
00:00:35.640 bota summoning at the copy of refrain
00:00:37.640 summon or search out for the couet here
00:00:40.559 KLA whatever it's French so it's I'm
00:00:42.480 going to call it KLA we're going to see
00:00:44.000 the KLA effect because it added to hand
00:00:45.680 like a popler it's going to be able to
00:00:47.600 special out a level four from the
00:00:49.160 graveyard from or the hand we're going
00:00:51.320 to see them sum up the soprano here
00:00:52.520 soprano is going to activate effects
00:00:53.760 adding back a copy of refrain and then
00:00:55.680 we're going to activate the couplet in
00:00:56.800 the scale so we're going to little
00:00:58.160 search for a copy of the conserto here
00:01:01.440 and now we have a few options depending
00:01:03.399 on what we go through next we're going
00:01:05.280 to either see the copy of conserto or uh
00:01:09.240 the soprano depending on what combo we
00:01:10.759 want to go to we could go right into the
00:01:12.680 copy of a that they are reading right
00:01:14.560 now this going to help you play through
00:01:16.000 n be and stuff like that being able to
00:01:17.720 bounce cards absolutely
00:01:20.479 incredible an amazing card to be honest
00:01:23.079 you also see a copy of Sonata in the
00:01:24.759 hand as well
00:01:30.320 but we could
00:01:32.360 see the conserto going to be activated
00:01:34.799 here using the copy of uh both scales to
00:01:37.880 summon up the second copy of the bota
00:01:40.240 and then we're going to be seeing the
00:01:41.240 effects to scale them both this is going
00:01:42.720 to be the big YouTube combo you know the
00:01:45.640 this is like I think the appoo two mat
00:01:49.119 um alongside a copy of um whatever it
00:01:53.600 name is the cross sheep and the vortex
00:01:56.640 Dragon I believe we're going be seeing
00:01:59.000 the scales Le going into a copy of the
00:02:02.560 absolute and yeah this is the vortex
00:02:04.399 combo there we're going to be seeing
00:02:05.840 them chain the effect of store of
00:02:08.038 chandelier here sending the copy of the
00:02:13.599 uh the roll back to set and this is
00:02:16.400 going to be kind of indicating that you
00:02:17.840 know they don't want that copy of Vortex
00:02:20.800 being able to negate their cards uh kind
00:02:22.959 of important you know especially when
00:02:24.080 you're discarding two cards to kind of
00:02:25.480 get through that we're going to see them
00:02:27.160 go into the cross sheep there and then
00:02:28.560 we're going to be activating the effect
00:02:30.000 of the
00:02:33.720 vortex and the botcha to summon out the
00:02:36.760 copy of the couplet and then we're also
00:02:39.239 going to
00:02:40.800 be summoning The Vortex and we also got
00:02:43.640 the conserto as well to draw
00:02:48.879 one now we're going to be seeing the
00:02:50.840 effect of cross sheep summon out the
00:02:52.280 copy of the soprano once again so now we
00:02:55.680 have all four bodies or all three bodies
00:02:57.680 that we want to kind of extend um
00:03:00.560 now we're going to be seeing them go
00:03:01.840 into the copy
00:03:03.840 of the appala for three
00:03:11.120 here we don't have any melodius now on
00:03:14.959 the field anymore for the coner for the
00:03:18.319 soprano
00:03:22.879 there we do have a pendulum something we
00:03:25.120 can make here the refrain and the
00:03:26.599 couplet and then that can let us
00:03:30.840 I feel like we should have summoned out
00:03:32.159 the can we have a cannon and
00:03:35.439 a Sonata in the hand so you probably
00:03:37.959 should have left that copy of
00:03:44.560 uh
00:03:47.480 of the fusion onto the field here but
00:03:50.280 we're going to be going into a copy of
00:03:56.480 Ip and just setting one card and passing
00:03:59.000 on that yeah so not a very good
00:04:00.760 melodious end board but it is a very
00:04:02.840 Omni negator end board with the uh a
00:04:06.159 bunch of other search cards that we can
00:04:07.400 do
00:04:08.200 to you probably should have special
00:04:10.400 summoned out the cannon and then
00:04:12.959 probably gone for the appala there and
00:04:15.319 use that to fuse with the Sonata going
00:04:18.079 into maybe a copy of
00:04:20.600 uh of the um shaba there cuz shabber is
00:04:25.160 really good against the
00:04:26.759 uh the Lapin deck being able to banish
00:04:29.240 those carrots
00:04:32.320 but we're going to be seeing the normal
00:04:34.440 summon of a Shand drag leier then we're
00:04:36.320 going to go into a copy of s with the IP
00:04:41.800 there and we're going to activate the
00:04:45.039 effect and if we target the back row
00:04:47.160 it's going to most likely be flipped
00:04:48.560 face up uh
00:05:01.800 but they're going to be chaining the
00:05:03.479 effect of Shan Drager here and we're
00:05:05.840 chaining appala to negate that s the
00:05:08.039 copy of Duma Canon and then I chain the
00:05:10.560 copy of big welcome do we Vortex Dragon
00:05:24.880 this we're going to chain Vortex I think
00:05:27.680 we chained the copy of the
00:05:33.880 uh of the Trap roll back there to try to
00:05:37.360 copy the Duma
00:05:50.880 Cannon looking at their extra deting
00:05:53.400 what they
00:05:55.000 have but they're going to chain SP as
00:05:58.440 well and okay so they targeted the copy
00:06:01.240 of Shand Drager
00:06:03.160 okay interesting choice we're going to
00:06:05.440 be seeing the Shan Drager then being
00:06:06.919 activated to add back to the hand we
00:06:09.039 also destroy the appoa with the copy of
00:06:12.199 druma Cannon which then triggers to add
00:06:15.240 back and we summon out the copy of
00:06:16.560 Ariana bouncing it back to the hand not
00:06:19.080 being great cuz we already have normal
00:06:20.880 summoned
00:06:25.639 um and they realized their mistake there
00:06:28.080 they should have definitely done lady um
00:06:31.319 but we're going to be
00:06:32.960 seeing those two summon back out and
00:06:35.120 they do just realize that they yeah that
00:06:36.919 was definitely a bit of a throw I don't
00:06:38.599 think it would have made a bit of a
00:06:39.800 difference because we did have other
00:06:41.840 stuff but we summoned a lady from the
00:06:43.160 hands uh then we have like a trap I
00:06:46.240 think we saw a copy of
00:06:50.680 um of punishment there so like
00:06:54.000 punishment but then that would have been
00:06:55.160 hit with a copy of the vortex and then
00:06:58.000 just like okay well then you have other
00:06:59.599 trap has to kind of do something for
00:07:00.879 them lady to be chained to it um at that
00:07:03.280 point like you do still have the big
00:07:04.560 welcome bounce but it's just like are
00:07:07.240 you forced you're kind of forced to go
00:07:08.560 like big welcome bounce to Vortex Vortex
00:07:10.560 negates and then use a punishment to
00:07:13.440 stop something else so guess they did
00:07:15.800 they did have stuff that they could use
00:07:19.080 just unfortunately not going to be
00:07:20.520 enough especially when you just make a
00:07:21.840 misplay by normal something with that
00:07:23.160 copy of Shand Drager you know it does
00:07:25.039 happen sometimes where you do make those
00:07:26.400 little kind of misplays that they get
00:07:28.080 punished uh we saw like you know using
00:07:30.479 that copy of the shopro there and not
00:07:34.360 just summoning up the copy of Canon or
00:07:36.280 the uh Sonata to use that definitely
00:07:39.000 punish them they would have been able to
00:07:40.120 banish those cards before they would
00:07:41.919 even be able to activate the second
00:07:43.400 effect of Shand drag leier you know very
00:07:45.840 nice but we're going to be seeing the
00:07:47.680 Labyrinth player here start off with a
00:07:49.960 copy of Aras which can then set a copy
00:07:52.400 of trap tricks then we're going to be
00:07:54.039 activating the Trap trick stair to let
00:07:55.319 us seven or getting us set a big welcome
00:07:59.720 already getting rid of one big welcome
00:08:01.199 is very important there we did the
00:08:02.759 normal sumon with the copy of Ariana
00:08:04.240 activating it effects letting us search
00:08:06.080 for a copy of lady you know now we have
00:08:08.720 all the cards on the field we summon up
00:08:10.599 the lady then we can summon up the big
00:08:11.919 welcome or we can acate big welcome here
00:08:13.919 chain the lady set I don't quite see
00:08:16.360 what we set there
00:08:18.039 unfortunately we're going to be
00:08:20.120 summoning out the lovely and then we
00:08:21.960 bounce to the hand the copy of
00:08:26.639 Ariana and if we are playing the
00:08:28.440 Unchained cards
00:08:30.080 we see lovely pop lovely popping a copy
00:08:32.279 of couet here being a really good pop
00:08:35.599 we're going seeing lovely reset that
00:08:37.559 copy of big welcome and then just
00:08:38.679 passing turn on
00:08:40.479 this so not playing those Unchained
00:08:42.719 cards we are playing Eradicator so we
00:08:45.040 will trib the copy of lovely
00:08:51.240 here and do we chain
00:08:54.600 lady we're going to chain droplet
00:08:56.959 sending
00:08:58.160 concerto and we we chain big welcome
00:09:00.880 here then we chain the lady as
00:09:05.680 well so really valuing that set off the
00:09:10.079 lady I think we see Juma Canon set and
00:09:12.720 we do see a blackjack in the hand as
00:09:18.440 well summoning out the copy of
00:09:20.760 strawberry
00:09:21.839 tby fing get back to the hand then we're
00:09:24.200 going to be seeing dras negating the
00:09:25.640 copy of the lady and they're going to
00:09:27.920 take a second to read these we do see
00:09:30.320 the uh copy of shapen and we also see a
00:09:35.279 couplet and then a reframe as well so
00:09:37.160 they have the one card normal um if we
00:09:41.320 can stop this it's it's kind of
00:09:42.760 important to stop it uh very good
00:09:46.680 card then when we seeing the effect here
00:09:49.200 of the story T we sending the copy of
00:09:51.920 the Blackjack to the graveyard to set
00:09:54.279 the welcome Labyrinth I believe it was
00:09:56.800 and then we're going seeing the
00:09:57.560 Blackjack effect and we do put a trap on
00:10:00.920 the top of the
00:10:04.360 deck we do see a refrain being normal
00:10:09.000 here activating the effect and this is
00:10:11.760 the full full
00:10:13.320 combo or I guess one of the combos we
00:10:16.519 kind of have to search for the Sonata
00:10:18.320 here being the extender because we
00:10:20.519 already have the conserto in the
00:10:22.200 graveyard
00:10:23.600 unfortunately so we're going to be
00:10:25.079 seeing the Blackjack going to be hitting
00:10:27.279 a copy of trap tricks there it looks
00:10:29.040 like
00:10:30.320 which will give them access to any trap
00:10:32.160 that they really
00:10:37.519 want couplet not being like the only
00:10:39.959 card they currently really have is the
00:10:42.959 Sonata that can summon itself out and
00:10:44.800 even then like they're going to get kind
00:10:45.800 of punished here we're going to see the
00:10:47.360 Sonata being summoned and are we going
00:10:48.680 to be seeing a dumac Canon being
00:10:49.959 banished flipping those face down we
00:10:51.519 could see that right away we're going to
00:10:53.279 be seeing the Trap tricks hitting that
00:10:54.639 copy of punishment there so setting
00:10:56.600 another copy of punishment and then
00:10:57.920 flipping up that punishment right away I
00:10:59.720 believe now we're going to be seeing a
00:11:01.519 copy of entis being sent to get rid of
00:11:03.120 both of
00:11:08.120 them going to be seeing a cop I think
00:11:11.480 that was like kind no it was an okay
00:11:13.880 popping both of them leaving them with
00:11:15.079 absolutely nothing and Labyrinth takes
00:11:16.600 game
00:11:17.480 too I mean yeah honestly I feel
00:11:22.920 like if we didn't have conserto there to
00:11:27.600 send off of
00:11:30.079 the droplets like you know they're
00:11:32.240 calling spell so you have to send
00:11:34.320 conserto for free it's
00:11:37.920 like which forces out the big welcome
00:11:41.480 it's the melodious player played it like
00:11:43.800 as good as they can their just hand
00:11:45.000 wasn't good enough um which was fine
00:11:47.320 like this conser draw just kind of bad
00:11:49.360 alongside the double couplet and then of
00:11:51.200 course the shapen as well that's kind of
00:11:53.399 like the point of the game that
00:11:55.560 like it's kind of hard I have been
00:11:57.839 playing two concertos I was is also
00:11:59.519 playing desires and prosperity at two
00:12:01.720 and two which I really do enjoy playing
00:12:03.880 like two two and two so concerto as well
00:12:07.200 as two droplets or two uh two
00:12:09.079 prosperities and two
00:12:10.800 desires let those hands where you do see
00:12:12.880 the concern or not be as bad being able
00:12:14.519 to Surge and then also like if you
00:12:15.639 forget the effect it is like no big
00:12:23.639 deal
00:12:25.600 but we are going to be seeing the Asado
00:12:29.480 a card here and that's going to go
00:12:32.639 through are we going to choose to go for
00:12:34.240 a
00:12:35.720 complete omate kind of end board are
00:12:38.160 we're going to choose to kind of focus
00:12:39.399 more on those uh copies of M
00:12:43.480 shta like a TW is not that good in this
00:12:46.240 matchup compared to those onni negates
00:12:48.360 like Vortex dragon as well as the appoa
00:12:50.240 being able to negate those Shand drers
00:12:52.399 and the storit ores as well as the K
00:12:54.480 clocks is uh quite good here we see the
00:12:56.839 send of refrain and then the soprano
00:12:58.560 once again going for that copy of baka
00:13:00.920 actually the effect of the
00:13:04.440 Baka and they're going to read it here
00:13:07.480 will we see maybe an imperm we are going
00:13:09.040 to be seeing an imperm on the
00:13:11.839 botcha which is a nice impm they do have
00:13:14.279 a refrain in the hand I do
00:13:19.639 believe so we're still going be able to
00:13:21.519 go through that combo there and then
00:13:22.720 we're able to search for the copy of
00:13:24.680 couet couet can then summon out the copy
00:13:26.480 of the soprano from the graveyard which
00:13:29.160 can then add back that copy of the
00:13:31.760 refrain if we want
00:13:39.240 to we do have a copy of Aras in the hand
00:13:42.160 as well with alongside of a
00:13:44.160 trap but we're not going to do soprano
00:13:46.560 to add back maybe trying to use that
00:13:48.000 later on in the turn or if we can s up
00:13:51.000 the copy of botcha here we we I guess
00:13:54.560 we'll probably fuse with that and add
00:13:57.759 back
00:13:59.560 if you have like another body in the
00:14:00.800 hand like I see a copy of
00:14:02.680 Sonata so I have a feeling that we could
00:14:04.720 maybe go for a copy of a twil early on
00:14:06.639 or just trying to go
00:14:08.680 for maybe the second bota it kind of
00:14:11.120 depends on really where they want to go
00:14:12.480 with
00:14:16.480 this I also see the Shand drag leier in
00:14:18.959 the hand as well so we know we have Aras
00:14:21.880 Shand drag leier
00:14:31.160 and a
00:14:32.839 trap which I think is a welcome
00:14:38.040 Labyrinth I see conserto
00:14:41.199 here using the refrain couplet to go for
00:14:46.519 the second bota so trying to go for that
00:14:48.519 copy of the absolute Dragon once
00:14:52.959 again going to see them scale and then
00:14:55.000 we're to ask for the effect of the
00:14:57.720 refrain targeting the second copy of the
00:15:00.680 botcha so this is going to be kind of
00:15:02.800 probably our Target that we kind of want
00:15:04.079 to summon
00:15:05.600 out for that
00:15:09.279 uh we're going to add back to the hand
00:15:11.560 with that copy of soprano when we summon
00:15:13.320 it back out here most
00:15:16.399 likely but we're going to go for the OD
00:15:18.839 eyes and then we're going to see the
00:15:20.399 Ariana activates effects
00:15:23.600 here sem note the copy of Arya and we're
00:15:27.040 going to be seeing her effects or Ariana
00:15:29.199 here we're going to see here effect
00:15:30.839 search for a copy of K clock oh shit's
00:15:34.120 getting real K clock is going to
00:15:35.759 activate effects and we're going to see
00:15:37.720 a copy of stor or Shane Drager sending
00:15:40.920 the copy of Welcome to set a copy of big
00:15:45.000 which we can activate right
00:15:48.279 away then we're to see the star
00:15:50.800 activates effects and we have an ash for
00:15:52.720 the big welcome that is huge we do have
00:15:55.160 the RS that can sself out but that's
00:15:57.440 going to stop the the the Labyrinth
00:15:59.399 players combo right away and we used our
00:16:01.120 whole hand here very crazy how the whole
00:16:03.959 hand has been used and it's not even our
00:16:07.639 turn we're going to see them go into the
00:16:09.959 copy of cross sheep and we're going to
00:16:13.600 be seeing the OD eyes the copy of the
00:16:16.560 conserto and the botcha summon out
00:16:20.480 here so we're going to summon out a copy
00:16:24.279 of the couplet this is so just so that
00:16:27.639 we could get a vortex text kind of have
00:16:30.000 that negate there um when it gets put to
00:16:32.079 the extra deck and we're going be seeing
00:16:33.440 soprano soprano able to add back that
00:16:35.480 copy of
00:16:45.279 reframe and we we should go into a copy
00:16:48.240 of the shabber
00:16:53.480 here be able to banish big welcome the
00:16:56.519 copy
00:16:57.560 of wel welc and then the Shand drers
00:17:01.079 definitely a really good play which we
00:17:03.800 are going to be seeing weit the effect
00:17:06.240 there banishing all three leaving just
00:17:08.280 that imperm into the deck like that is
00:17:10.199 crazy triple DB Crow is absolutely
00:17:12.400 insane if we can get that copy of the uh
00:17:16.240 K clock as well in the following turn if
00:17:19.039 we can get a copy of let's say um the at
00:17:22.919 onto the field that's going to be very
00:17:24.760 devastating and we kind of have a chaos
00:17:27.039 Angel setup on the opponent's side of
00:17:28.480 the field but I don't know what else we
00:17:30.120 can really go
00:17:33.360 for going to see the copy of Sonata and
00:17:37.960 then I'm going to go right into a copy
00:17:39.360 of
00:17:41.640 appala you know making it so that we
00:17:44.080 have that extra Deck monster now into
00:17:46.880 the extra deck or that p face up
00:17:49.840 pendulum monster into the extra deck
00:17:51.000 which we are going to pendulum one right
00:17:52.080 away and I believe we're going to be
00:17:53.559 seeing them link right into an S IP
00:17:59.919 I don't believe SP triggers here unless
00:18:02.120 I'm mistaken I could be
00:18:04.840 wrong yeah it has to use the link
00:18:06.679 material
00:18:11.600 okay so we're going to see them go into
00:18:13.679 an
00:18:16.080 SP which they can't banish though it's
00:18:20.280 going to pass turn onto that so they
00:18:22.880 have Vortex a triple mat appala a veiler
00:18:26.440 in the hands and then an SP as well
00:18:30.200 SP has some really cool Synergy because
00:18:31.880 it can actually get rid of the vortex
00:18:34.120 dragon in itself to let aado or the
00:18:37.480 couplet be activated to let you search
00:18:39.000 for that copy of conserto Cu you have to
00:18:40.720 control no U I guess non melodious
00:18:44.760 monsters for
00:18:47.360 that and so we see a Yama being looked
00:18:50.559 at
00:18:51.559 here we're going to go into
00:19:01.039 I guess I really thinking about like
00:19:02.200 Yama or chaos Angel
00:19:13.000 here but Vortex dragon is at 3K
00:19:17.200 defense so it's going to be kind of hard
00:19:19.679 here I don't know if we have enough to
00:19:22.559 make it like we're going to be seeing
00:19:24.440 Yama can search it's not going to do
00:19:26.159 very much we could go for the anguish
00:19:28.200 but it's it's all of it's not going to
00:19:29.919 do anything against an appala and an SP
00:19:32.320 alongside of
00:19:39.080 Vortex we're going to go for the Yama
00:19:41.919 here and we don't activate the effect
00:19:47.039 we're go battle phase attack into the SP
00:19:49.440 that is one way to deal with one of
00:19:50.640 those cards you know dealing 400 damage
00:19:53.679 then we're going to go
00:19:55.440 into copy OFA to tie to suck up that
00:19:59.039 copy of appala and they do appal in the
00:20:02.080 gate that is two materials down or I
00:20:04.480 guess two interruptions of
00:20:06.960 the
00:20:09.559 five we can then go into the copy of SP
00:20:12.919 or an anguish here I'm going to safely
00:20:15.120 assume it's going to be an anguish
00:20:28.880 going to be attempting to
00:20:36.799 take we're going to see the anguish
00:20:38.840 effect Target the appoa is going to be
00:20:40.320 hit once again bringing it down to 800
00:20:43.240 we have gone through three of the
00:20:44.520 materials here or three of the
00:20:46.200 interruptions and just passing turn on
00:20:48.760 that you know Vortex is still there and
00:20:51.120 we can't even destroy it so we're going
00:20:52.200 to some with the copy of Anguish once
00:20:53.720 again
00:20:55.760 um we're going to activate the effect
00:20:58.400 and and we can't do that cuz we do
00:21:00.640 control a uh non melodious monsters here
00:21:04.760 conserto has or I guess not concerto but
00:21:08.840 the couplet has to have no face up non
00:21:11.960 melodious monsters or no monsters on the
00:21:13.840 field at all for to activate there so
00:21:15.919 definitely cannot do
00:21:20.480 that we're going to be seeing the
00:21:22.679 illegal conserto being activated there
00:21:25.279 using these scales to summon up a copy
00:21:27.520 of most likely the triple DD Crow once
00:21:30.200 again here or it should be the triple DD
00:21:33.120 Crow once
00:21:34.919 again the shabber and then we're going
00:21:37.600 be able to scale both of them here then
00:21:40.120 we ac the effect of refrain to Target
00:21:42.200 the copy of uh shabber and send if we
00:21:45.120 want to kind of boost that
00:21:51.159 attack we're going to pendulum summon
00:21:53.440 out both these here reframe will then be
00:21:55.720 able to search
00:22:03.120 and we search for most likely for a copy
00:22:05.080 of Sonata just trying to go for that
00:22:07.400 attack
00:22:08.840 boost or a couplet couplet can then
00:22:11.400 summon out the copy of the soprano and
00:22:13.720 we're going to be seeing that add back
00:22:15.080 the copy of Sonata here
00:22:17.320 okay kind of the same thing we're going
00:22:20.039 to see the effect activating they're
00:22:21.480 going to banish the Yama that's is going
00:22:22.840 to be game right there on board you know
00:22:25.039 they can go for really anything they
00:22:26.520 want there unfortunately the concerto
00:22:29.159 search was very illegal which kind of
00:22:31.760 assisted them to get game but I feel
00:22:34.080 like we still would have had that you
00:22:35.279 know being able to have that APPA and
00:22:37.000 then of course the
00:22:39.080 vortex being an omate is essentially
00:22:41.640 huge against a deck that is on very low
00:22:43.840 cards regardless hope watching the video
00:22:46.240 Don't for to like comment have to see
00:22:47.360 more content like this to stay safe
00:22:49.440 peace
