# https://www.youtube.com/watch/J35_qVKQ8aU

00:00:00.040 Yu-Gi-Oh can be an expensive Hobby and
00:00:01.920 if you're not looking to spend a ton of
00:00:03.280 money into the game it can be
00:00:04.319 frustrating when other people have way
00:00:06.399 better cards than you however there are
00:00:08.000 many times where a budget option can
00:00:09.679 succeed pretty effectively and before I
00:00:11.840 talked about how marincess was a good
00:00:13.559 option in the last format now there's a
00:00:15.120 new budget deck that has a totally
00:00:16.640 different play style from marincess is
00:00:18.320 super cheap and accessible and also
00:00:20.080 rather solid into the metag game so I'm
00:00:21.920 going to show you guys why I think you
00:00:24.080 should be picking up early now if you
00:00:26.679 guys want to see me bring this de to
00:00:27.960 locals and have an example of how to
00:00:29.480 play it then like subscribe and again
00:00:31.679 just let me know because I'm happy to
00:00:33.600 bring this to locals and do a tournament
00:00:36.320 replay review type thing where I can
00:00:38.160 give you all the explanations behind why
00:00:40.039 I do the choices I do now also you know
00:00:42.039 got my X seved up in Supreme Pros so go
00:00:44.800 to txx one.com and use the code potato
00:00:47.320 10 10% off side wide got these white
00:00:50.239 sleeves you know those are my favorite
00:00:52.000 and uh they won't do you wrong now you
00:00:53.600 may be wondering why pearly well with
00:00:55.680 the release of Rarity collection 2 all
00:00:58.280 the ultra rares from amazing Defenders
00:01:00.039 not been reprinted as super rares and
00:01:01.920 whatever the hell else Rarity comes in
00:01:03.000 Rarity collection 2 meaning they're
00:01:04.479 effectively worthless like pearly and
00:01:06.840 that means that the entirety of the deck
00:01:08.159 is extremely low Rarity split between
00:01:09.759 two different sets besides that you have
00:01:11.479 Staples of course and uh you may want to
00:01:14.200 play cards like as Zeus however those
00:01:15.960 cards aren't integral to the deck number
00:01:17.920 say you wouldn't play SP period whereas
00:01:19.880 this deck would definitely benefit from
00:01:21.520 SP It ultimately isn't an integral part
00:01:24.520 to the deck's success so now this deck
00:01:26.680 is just overall really cheap and I'll
00:01:28.720 show you guys how much it costs for the
00:01:30.640 entire Deck with staples and without
00:01:32.520 Staples we already have them from like
00:01:33.759 the last budg of deck you played um but
00:01:35.720 what is cool about pearly is it plays
00:01:38.640 very unlike almost any other deck it can
00:01:40.680 go second pretty well while also still
00:01:42.079 being a deck that can Thrive going first
00:01:43.799 you can play a high number of non-engine
00:01:45.960 and consistent because pretty much every
00:01:47.360 card in your deck searches another card
00:01:48.560 in the deck meaning it's really cool how
00:01:50.479 this deck flows almost fluidly um but it
00:01:52.719 doesn't play the same every game at all
00:01:54.040 it's not like a deck like snake eye
00:01:55.119 where even though every card is
00:01:55.880 accessible games feel very similar also
00:01:57.840 thankfully because most of your cards
00:01:58.960 are spell cards you don't have the
00:02:00.600 problem that a lot of decks have where
00:02:02.159 you stuck with a bunch of normal summons
00:02:03.399 or cards that are only once per turn in
00:02:04.759 your hand and you have redundancy
00:02:05.960 problems and this deck draw multiples of
00:02:07.680 cards that aren't your monsters
00:02:09.080 specifically isn't a problem because
00:02:10.878 barrowing a few restrictions they aren't
00:02:12.280 kept at only once per turn so I'm going
00:02:14.000 to go over what my deck list would look
00:02:15.319 like as a sample deck uh kept in budget
00:02:18.000 and there's not going to be an SP in
00:02:19.080 here and then I'm also going to go over
00:02:20.239 briefly what the effects do of the cards
00:02:21.840 if you're already familiar with pearly
00:02:22.959 then just sit through it because I will
00:02:24.280 have other explanations in here but I do
00:02:26.840 want to give players who are new to the
00:02:27.879 game and wanting to learn a good idea
00:02:29.640 with the does now if you're specifically
00:02:31.160 new to the game I think this deck is
00:02:32.239 perfect because it does have a steep
00:02:33.680 learning curve now that may mean losing
00:02:35.319 a bit at the beginning but it will teach
00:02:37.160 you a lot of the skills that you can
00:02:38.480 build upon to get better at the game
00:02:40.200 because you're not going to have very
00:02:41.480 easy instant wins you are going to have
00:02:42.879 to be very meticulous about your choices
00:02:44.239 cuz a lot of cases but gum town to you
00:02:46.280 making a decision or a read based on how
00:02:48.000 your opponent plays and while that can
00:02:49.800 sound daunting it really rewards players
00:02:52.080 for playing well and if there's a deck
00:02:53.280 with a high skill cap uh in the game
00:02:55.000 this is one of the highest I think okay
00:02:57.440 so let's start off with our pearly
00:02:59.440 engine here here I'm playing two of the
00:03:01.080 black cats and three of the white cats
00:03:03.280 so black cat here what it does on summon
00:03:05.760 adds a pearly uh card next to hand
00:03:08.080 except the quick play spell so we can't
00:03:10.360 add our main engine cards but can add
00:03:11.959 another copy of itself you can add a
00:03:13.360 pearly or uh your continue spell your
00:03:15.840 field spell or your trap and then this
00:03:17.239 one let you rank up from the grave all
00:03:19.519 the ply spells have a corresponding baby
00:03:21.280 kitten or whatever H you want to call it
00:03:22.959 that you can rank up to with these main
00:03:24.799 cats uh and they require you to use the
00:03:27.280 material that is corresponding to the
00:03:29.200 monsters so happy memory can Su out
00:03:32.879 happiness where is it happiness now this
00:03:36.599 one ranks up from the graves so that
00:03:37.879 means is once on the field if happy
00:03:40.439 memory is in your grave you can attach
00:03:42.599 rank up and Bam so this one is once per
00:03:46.200 turn which is why I only play two of the
00:03:47.439 black cats the cuz the deck is so
00:03:48.959 accessible you don't need multiples in
00:03:51.080 your hand or in one turn really just
00:03:53.000 looking over two over the course of the
00:03:54.159 game and you can Shuffle the back if you
00:03:55.599 really do need three so just two is fine
00:03:58.200 uh it's not like it's a crazy good card
00:03:59.400 to draw anyways now white cat is kind of
00:04:01.040 the reverse uh what it does on the
00:04:02.519 summon is you can excavate the top three
00:04:04.239 cards of your deck and add any pearly
00:04:05.439 card from your deck to your hand sorry
00:04:06.760 pearly spell traps you can't add another
00:04:08.000 monster which is important this is not
00:04:09.680 one's your turn neither is the effect to
00:04:11.079 rank up and ranks up in the hand so if
00:04:12.680 this is in my hand I can go effect rank
00:04:14.439 up and summon there going through
00:04:16.320 multiple these in the first turn and
00:04:17.600 going through multiple xeds try break
00:04:19.238 through the opponent's field is a big
00:04:20.839 part of learning how to break through it
00:04:22.919 and that's where a lot of the skill set
00:04:24.080 comes in right cuz you have to be
00:04:25.040 wondering if you going to use this spell
00:04:26.479 like use in your hand special from deck
00:04:28.400 or uh use its other effect or if you're
00:04:30.440 going to be ranking them up um and that
00:04:32.400 type of decision making is going to be
00:04:33.880 important whether be knowing which names
00:04:35.520 to hold for later to rank up correctly
00:04:37.479 or whether it's just managing the
00:04:39.320 resources between your hand or field
00:04:40.800 want to know here these are all level
00:04:41.840 ones and all fairies uh so you can do
00:04:44.800 some cool stuff with that stat lines
00:04:48.240 rank one specifically and fairies you'll
00:04:50.240 see why that matters shortly in the
00:04:51.560 extra deck and for the ply spells so
00:04:53.400 your quick play spells all have the same
00:04:55.759 concept uh and that is you can discard a
00:04:58.400 card so you apply effect uh and then you
00:05:01.240 can discard a card special summon a
00:05:03.199 pearly from the deck uh so either one of
00:05:05.039 these they're almost like your eali are
00:05:06.600 require discarding a card and they all
00:05:07.759 do that as well as having a bonus effect
00:05:09.120 which does matter they'll also have
00:05:10.600 their corresponding kittens in the actra
00:05:12.680 deck so you are going to max out on on
00:05:14.199 the compies you can play now important
00:05:15.759 the delicious and sleepy are at twos so
00:05:19.120 cannot find more of those you have 10
00:05:20.759 totals they all have different purposes
00:05:22.199 in their own right uh delicious memory
00:05:24.039 making guys unable by battle sleepy says
00:05:26.680 the next damage you take becomes zero
00:05:28.199 and pre memory gains 1,000 lives those
00:05:30.000 are super important maybe sometimes you
00:05:31.639 get away with Staying Alive because of
00:05:33.199 these but the other two have real
00:05:34.600 effects uh this says you can select the
00:05:36.280 mon in the field to canas show I battle
00:05:37.600 this turn this is important because you
00:05:39.240 can otk your opponent um pretty easily
00:05:41.520 with this card it's important to note
00:05:43.199 that uh one of your cards gets extra
00:05:45.080 attacks but it not attack directly so
00:05:46.520 you make their guy Invincible by battle
00:05:48.199 and then you attack into it several
00:05:49.199 times that's a way to kill them as well
00:05:50.479 as making your own guy instructible can
00:05:51.759 sometimes come up in grind games this is
00:05:53.680 memory protects any card in the field
00:05:55.199 from destruction once per turn so this
00:05:57.199 is really important playing through
00:05:58.240 field uh playing through ghost OG snow
00:06:00.000 rabbit and in odd cases like against
00:06:01.840 Unchained Fire King you can protect
00:06:03.680 their card from being destroyed so that
00:06:05.120 means if they try and like go uh unchain
00:06:07.400 a Rua Target a back you can go this make
00:06:09.840 it immune to destruction and the ARA
00:06:11.800 stays in hand they tricular effects and
00:06:13.479 yeah free value uh and then we're just
00:06:15.000 going to continue maxing out cards we're
00:06:16.160 playing three straight P Street and
00:06:17.720 terraforming so if you watch my cheer
00:06:19.840 list you you saw me say this wasn't like
00:06:21.880 the best deck in the format that was
00:06:23.720 largely in part to D barrier now that is
00:06:25.599 probably the biggest thing to overcome
00:06:26.639 and there's not really good solution for
00:06:27.720 that D barrier is going to be a problem
00:06:28.800 for this deck s rincess had the the
00:06:31.639 Silver Bullet of neiru that you couldn't
00:06:33.160 really control D barrier is going to be
00:06:34.880 a problem for this deck you you have
00:06:36.080 very few ways to mitigate it another
00:06:37.639 problems which is also kind of not a
00:06:39.120 problem is the deck is kind of weak
00:06:40.680 against the effects negation hand traps
00:06:43.280 like effect feeler in permanence of mner
00:06:44.919 because when you're stopping these pears
00:06:47.080 from using their effects to add a card
00:06:48.639 you're also stopping them from ranking
00:06:50.199 up uh whereas if you Ash this effect to
00:06:52.319 add you can still rank up and it's not
00:06:53.720 as bad so the target effect negation
00:06:55.280 hurts a lot more that being said it also
00:06:57.240 is bad against your deck because anytime
00:06:59.240 you've the street this cards are dead so
00:07:01.000 what does Street do Street says that uh
00:07:03.319 special summoned pees cannot be targeted
00:07:05.160 by your opponent's card effects that's
00:07:06.039 turn they're summoned uh any pearly
00:07:07.759 monster so your exceeds as well so if
00:07:09.800 you have this card then mner veiler
00:07:11.520 imper aren't going to be effective it
00:07:13.120 it's a weird dynamic because when you
00:07:14.599 have this card you really don't care if
00:07:15.840 their hand traps when you don't have
00:07:16.840 this card it hurts yeah that's why
00:07:18.479 you're maxing out the copies here at
00:07:19.479 four I think this card is important in
00:07:20.599 this format is everyone is playing a lot
00:07:21.840 of targeting hand traps what it also
00:07:23.360 does is when when your ply xeds die it's
00:07:26.360 mandatory revive or special from the
00:07:28.240 deck any ply level one from the deck or
00:07:30.319 grave so that's kind of cool um notice
00:07:33.000 with the next card you un often planned
00:07:35.039 will be to crash your monster into
00:07:36.199 theirs trigger your float abilities has
00:07:38.199 another ability as well that during the
00:07:39.280 end phase you can attach a p spell from
00:07:41.440 your grave or deck to a prly exceed uh
00:07:43.400 and that brings in a topic actually
00:07:45.479 forgot to talk about there is one of the
00:07:47.199 thing these pearly spells do they all
00:07:48.599 have abilities when they're attached to
00:07:49.879 a pearly XYZ I don't know why I forgot
00:07:51.520 to mention that because you're
00:07:52.280 incredibly important half memory let you
00:07:53.919 attack several times let you attack an
00:07:55.919 additional time for each pearly half
00:07:57.440 memory under it uh so if you have three
00:07:59.199 of them you can attack four times you
00:08:00.440 can only attack monsters though this
00:08:01.840 just gives whatever it's attach you 300
00:08:03.120 attack for each material it has you can
00:08:04.720 get your guys really big sleepy gives
00:08:06.440 you a draw each your opponent standby
00:08:08.159 phases for each leapy so it's very easy
00:08:10.280 to draw cards your opponent's turn and
00:08:11.800 this is why you'll often go perly attach
00:08:14.280 this in the end phase uh so you an extra
00:08:16.280 draw on their turn draw into hand traps
00:08:18.639 and this one is probably my favorite and
00:08:20.159 that is you can send a card it gives the
00:08:21.800 xceed the effect that once per turn you
00:08:23.560 can send a card you control to the Grave
00:08:25.639 Target a card your opponent controls and
00:08:26.960 attach it to your p's material so it can
00:08:29.039 build up a lot of materials as well as B
00:08:32.440 removal and solid for removal CU it
00:08:34.000 won't put it in the grave and it won't
00:08:35.399 affect destruction now if you have
00:08:36.640 multiple copies it becomes two for turn
00:08:38.360 or if you like overlay on top of a Ply
00:08:39.799 with a new ply then it resets the once
00:08:41.679 per turn triggers because it's it's a
00:08:43.200 very soft once per turn yes and then the
00:08:45.160 last pearly spell is again maxed out we
00:08:47.279 are not really doing any Innovative deck
00:08:49.200 building here and that is three uh that
00:08:51.399 is three my friend pearly so this card
00:08:53.519 is nuts as well you can see there's a
00:08:55.160 lot of power Behind these cards P 500
00:08:57.000 life points and you can reveal three
00:08:59.640 pearly cards in the deck your opponent
00:09:00.880 randomly picks one good to your hand and
00:09:02.240 yep that's why these being a two are
00:09:03.959 hits to the deck you don't guarantee any
00:09:06.519 one of them on the first turn anymore
00:09:08.160 however uh those are the two you want
00:09:10.040 going first as long as you can get one
00:09:11.320 of them you should be fine and this will
00:09:13.079 get one of them do have another ability
00:09:14.800 though and that is the one of your
00:09:15.839 pearly xeds is destroyed you can add
00:09:17.399 three pearly spells with different names
00:09:18.680 from C your hand sorry quick play spells
00:09:20.720 that's really strong because between
00:09:21.959 this and street if you're able to
00:09:23.240 connect an exed and say it's not the
00:09:25.120 exed with the right name because you
00:09:26.240 have to rank up from hand you have to
00:09:27.680 summon like this you crash
00:09:29.959 uh and say you broke through the field
00:09:31.480 uh burning through a bunch of spells I
00:09:33.079 can go okay you already had one of these
00:09:34.399 add back this then add back this and
00:09:36.120 revive this try add a card even if you
00:09:38.000 whiff it's fine now you have three more
00:09:39.079 cards in hand you can like push with so
00:09:40.959 that means using the battle phase but
00:09:42.320 that's where this deck kind of thrives a
00:09:44.079 bit uh this one is one of the ones per
00:09:45.600 turn on however still a three of because
00:09:47.440 if you draw it you'll search something
00:09:48.760 else and because all these discard to
00:09:50.519 special summon as well logging isn't the
00:09:52.160 end of the world cuz when you have
00:09:53.160 multiples you can discard this the extra
00:09:54.839 cards for something else um you're not
00:09:56.160 really playing the graveyard engine
00:09:57.800 although if you want to lighten up on
00:09:59.480 the non-engine of the deck you could put
00:10:00.959 more engine in the deck and rather than
00:10:02.760 like more ply cards cuz you already play
00:10:04.079 almost Max you just play a different
00:10:05.600 engine alongside it that complement the
00:10:07.839 discards so it could be tment cards it
00:10:09.959 could be like Dark World cards uh it
00:10:11.880 could be shidol cards those are some of
00:10:13.040 the common ones that we've seen played
00:10:14.519 in recent history uh something that's
00:10:16.240 cool is if you play like a shid all
00:10:17.200 package is provide discards via shid all
00:10:19.399 Beast shid all Hedgehog sh Sada or even
00:10:21.279 shid all Dragon which pops the back row
00:10:23.040 and then if you make any of your cat uh
00:10:25.480 exed which are rank two you can link it
00:10:27.920 away plus any the monster for a Sprite
00:10:29.680 Sprint send the T at merly and then make
00:10:31.920 W so you can end up W on your field and
00:10:34.480 that's pretty good uh and it's not a
00:10:36.120 huge package of cards you have to play
00:10:37.920 uh merly is not the greatest draw either
00:10:39.440 but it's fine if you discard merly for a
00:10:41.800 effect uh it will fuse which is cool you
00:10:43.839 me mud dragon so there there are like
00:10:45.839 options there which is why it's kind of
00:10:46.920 neat I currently think that non-engine
00:10:48.680 is too important in this meta game and
00:10:50.519 this deck can hold a high amount of
00:10:52.720 non-engine which is part of why it's
00:10:53.959 viable um so I'm taking advantage of
00:10:56.360 that fact rather than playing the
00:10:57.959 supplementary engine alongside it um and
00:11:00.160 then we got pearly so uh you can play
00:11:02.600 more of these cards ocg likes to play a
00:11:04.240 lot of this but I am a fan just one
00:11:06.440 because I think it's to searchable and
00:11:07.920 the game don't go long enough for need
00:11:08.959 multiple what it does is you can Target
00:11:10.800 a pearly XD control and then summon one
00:11:13.160 on top of it with a different rank uh so
00:11:14.800 you pretty much go from 2 to 7 and
00:11:16.079 you'll see the big cats do in a second
00:11:17.399 that's kind of where the wind condition
00:11:18.600 comes um into apparency and then can
00:11:20.839 banage it from the grave to Target three
00:11:22.320 pearly monsters in your grave and
00:11:23.519 shuffle them back so um you can recycle
00:11:25.760 your ex seeds and your white and black
00:11:27.480 cats if you do run out of them so you
00:11:28.880 shouldn't really a problem with Resource
00:11:30.600 Management in this deck largely in parts
00:11:32.399 of this card it's also important to note
00:11:33.680 that your opponent uses dark charm
00:11:34.800 against you uh it is a mistake a lot of
00:11:36.880 the time because you can chain this to
00:11:38.079 shuffle back your black Gat so a big
00:11:39.839 thing that a lot of people make a
00:11:40.920 mistake with and that is the Pearly
00:11:42.320 engine it is 22 cards so you can see why
00:11:44.760 this makes up a fair bit of non-engine
00:11:47.279 possibilities now the terraforming is a
00:11:49.240 bit extra for engine and then I'm
00:11:50.839 playing three prosperities as well just
00:11:52.680 more consistency um I'm not playing
00:11:54.880 Breakers in this deck so there's
00:11:56.279 argument to this being worse over post
00:11:58.200 side you can put board Breakers in there
00:11:59.279 are really good and this card is even
00:12:00.360 better uh and then sometimes are hand
00:12:02.040 traps that are fine enough when you go
00:12:03.839 second that pting into them is okay um I
00:12:06.639 guess specifically it's like ogre and
00:12:07.639 imprim that are okay but yeah I still
00:12:09.320 think this card is is important
00:12:11.079 especially to see cards like Street
00:12:12.639 which are I think really helpful going
00:12:14.839 first or even going second uh so if you
00:12:16.800 count these then you have 27 engine in
00:12:18.560 your deck or sorry 26 engine I can't
00:12:20.680 count which means you have 14 or 15 on
00:12:22.639 engine I want to the 15 played three ofs
00:12:24.880 instead uh at 41 cards you can argue
00:12:26.720 going down to 40 and just cutting down
00:12:28.240 whatever you do to be the worst engine
00:12:29.600 card in here uh and then it's just
00:12:31.320 simple hand traps cuz I still think
00:12:32.600 these are the best cards as if you
00:12:33.880 watched my metat teist video Ash veiler
00:12:38.440 biru and perm ogre um this deck doesn't
00:12:41.560 have any restrictions with in terms of
00:12:42.880 what hand shs can play some decks May
00:12:44.440 struggle with the biru CU they require
00:12:45.600 no monsters and Fields this is doesn't
00:12:47.199 have a problem with that so have no
00:12:48.880 worry there I think ogre's good because
00:12:50.279 one weaknesses that can kind of have is
00:12:52.920 uh IP into SP uh it's a really strong
00:12:55.079 play against this deck because the SP
00:12:56.519 will deal with the uh Street and then
00:12:58.880 the P secondary effect can banish the
00:13:01.320 cat trying to rank up so it trades up
00:13:02.920 very well uh and this while being a hand
00:13:04.760 trap can also push through IP so I am a
00:13:07.320 fan of ogre in that manner and then I
00:13:09.480 think it's good versus a lot of decks
00:13:10.480 right now um I've been liking this card
00:13:11.959 more and more I still think these are
00:13:13.399 probably better hand traps but I am
00:13:15.000 liking this more than mner and droll
00:13:17.079 right now if I'm going above 15 hand
00:13:19.240 traps or above 12 hand traps so simple
00:13:21.160 deck 41 cards nothing Innovative but uh
00:13:23.560 it should be all relatively budget
00:13:26.000 friendly and then get into the EXT real
00:13:27.519 quick let's explain what the Pearly
00:13:30.240 cards do so the two baby cats you summon
00:13:32.680 going first most of the time are plump
00:13:34.000 and Noir so each baby kitten will have
00:13:35.720 its corresponding spell and then it'll
00:13:38.160 have an ability plus the bonus ability
00:13:40.279 it gets attached if it has that uh that
00:13:43.160 the corresponding spell attached to it
00:13:44.320 which in this deck it will cuz you're
00:13:45.279 not summoning it via the two LEL twos
00:13:46.839 methods then they also all have another
00:13:48.800 effect it says when you activate a Ply
00:13:50.360 spell you can directly in response chain
00:13:52.519 its ability to attach that P spell to
00:13:54.240 the monster and then do something else
00:13:56.320 so what this one does is when you use a
00:13:57.680 Ply spell you can chain and attach the
00:13:59.560 ply spell so ideally here you can attach
00:14:00.880 another sleepy or a pretty memory to
00:14:02.560 suck up Monsters uh and then this one
00:14:05.040 sets any ply trap from deck you can set
00:14:07.079 the yeep which will let you rank up to
00:14:09.000 your big cat on your opponent's turn uh
00:14:11.240 and that's obviously very strong cuz
00:14:12.279 you'll see why the big cat's so
00:14:13.160 important as other fact is you can
00:14:14.399 discard a card you target one card in
00:14:16.040 the field or two if it has the
00:14:17.120 corresponding one in the as material and
00:14:19.000 return them to the hand so that's not a
00:14:20.040 quick effect that effect isn't super
00:14:21.240 important but biggest thing here is this
00:14:23.000 one going first cards cuzz it gets you
00:14:24.279 access to De that's important another
00:14:25.880 the sleeping memory here is once per
00:14:27.160 copy and once per monster that it's
00:14:29.079 summoned so if you have two under here
00:14:30.880 cuz you have you ranked up into it and
00:14:32.839 then you use field spell in the end
00:14:34.519 phase and you attach the second one in
00:14:36.600 the end
00:14:38.199 phase and you have two sleepies you'll
00:14:40.160 draw two cards and then during your
00:14:42.000 opponent standby phase after you drawn
00:14:43.360 two cards use this to rank up your big
00:14:45.600 cat you can use these again so you can
00:14:47.160 draw four cards uh and then with the
00:14:48.519 hand traps my deck you can see how it
00:14:50.560 kind of spirals into a very strong game
00:14:52.639 State you can't lose and the big cat's
00:14:54.440 really good honestly even without the uh
00:14:56.240 the draws you probably fine but yeah so
00:14:58.480 that is Noir the next one is plump it's
00:15:01.000 a one of as well I mean you can always
00:15:02.079 recycle these with yeep but uh it's
00:15:04.040 again best used for going first uh or
00:15:06.160 used for going second if you have to
00:15:07.759 crash a guy in and add resources back so
00:15:09.839 what this one does is a quick effect you
00:15:11.560 target up two spells and traps in the
00:15:12.920 grave and attach some as material to
00:15:14.800 itself so it gets kind of big and that
00:15:16.720 kind of corresponds with delicious
00:15:18.040 getting attack for each material however
00:15:19.759 this has another application is that you
00:15:21.040 can use it as a bit of an interrupt as
00:15:22.320 well that is when you use a quick play
00:15:23.560 spell you can immediately attach quick
00:15:24.720 play spell then you can banish a monster
00:15:26.040 on the field Until the End phase so it's
00:15:28.000 like SP in that way and this one yeah
00:15:29.680 corresponds with delicious you you'll do
00:15:31.519 here is this will this will help you for
00:15:33.399 going first cuz the big cat will require
00:15:35.360 five materials under uh a PR little
00:15:37.480 kitten to summon on top so if you can go
00:15:39.920 like summon this attach two more onto it
00:15:42.920 and then use the effect to attach summon
00:15:45.160 the big cat on top then we are good
00:15:47.199 here's your two going first kittens and
00:15:49.519 then the other two which will we can use
00:15:52.079 going firstfly Beauty are these two okay
00:15:55.199 so you play two of these cuz are way
00:15:56.199 more important foring a second so these
00:15:57.800 will get interrupted a lot more and
00:15:59.720 Beauty this solid so this is like just
00:16:02.040 quick effect uh negated monster it's not
00:16:04.560 a quick effect if you don't have the
00:16:05.639 pretty memor material but usually it
00:16:07.480 will so yeah so quick effect negate is
00:16:09.360 like a fine interrupt this really isn't
00:16:11.440 what you plan on ending on uh if you
00:16:13.240 could do this with a face down SN cuz
00:16:14.759 you can negate and then turn into the to
00:16:16.639 the big cat afterwards even through
00:16:18.160 breaking Fields this can help you
00:16:19.199 through negates cuz it just forces
00:16:21.040 something out and whenever you have a
00:16:23.319 quick play spell you can chain effect to
00:16:25.360 attach and you can change the battle
00:16:27.120 position of a monster on the field so
00:16:29.519 uh you can turn their guys to attack or
00:16:30.639 defense which matter largely in part
00:16:32.319 because of this card remember how I said
00:16:33.240 you can attack several times that'll
00:16:34.399 matter with this so you'll see why this
00:16:35.920 lines up here in a second yeah this one
00:16:37.440 corresponding spell is your pretty
00:16:40.199 memory the last step one that
00:16:42.079 corresponds will be happy memory with
00:16:44.880 happiness and play two of these cuz
00:16:46.480 again this one's really important going
00:16:48.120 second uh and what this does is anytime
00:16:50.079 it battles after damage calculation add
00:16:52.079 a PR spell from NE to hand so this means
00:16:53.440 if you attack with it and then guys in
00:16:55.079 defense mode which is why you may want
00:16:56.079 to turn the guys to defense you can add
00:16:57.519 one from NE to hand you can add this use
00:16:59.519 the effect to activate chain the effect
00:17:01.839 to attach have an extra attack now
00:17:03.759 attack again so you can build up
00:17:04.919 materials that way what it also does uh
00:17:07.199 as if you have this as material after it
00:17:09.359 battles it can have the attack of
00:17:10.480 monster on the field and not that none
00:17:11.599 of that once's per turn you can keep
00:17:13.319 going attack attack attack attack Mak
00:17:15.079 the guy smaller and then you while
00:17:16.559 you're building up materials you have
00:17:17.640 this under it or you search this and
00:17:18.839 attach it it'll also grow in attack
00:17:20.240 points so you can up like 3K attack 3K
00:17:22.559 attack 3K attack they're dead so that's
00:17:24.400 why you may want an attack right if you
00:17:25.520 make their guy indestructible by an
00:17:26.679 attack mode and then turn it to attack
00:17:28.480 or they left it in attack you can just
00:17:30.520 attack a billion times or if you can't
00:17:32.400 kill them you turn to defense mode or
00:17:34.200 leave the guy in defense mode and you
00:17:35.280 attack four times get four searches and
00:17:37.760 then you can play another way what it
00:17:40.240 also does is uh when it attaches so you
00:17:42.440 go activate your chain to attach you can
00:17:44.400 turn a spell trap on the field of the
00:17:45.559 hand um which isn't too important but
00:17:48.039 they can help some sometimes clear up
00:17:49.080 the field so that are all the baby
00:17:50.679 kittens are all here it's obviously
00:17:52.679 really good of Zeus as well building up
00:17:53.840 materials for like an eight mat or six
00:17:55.480 mat eight mats is ambitious like a six
00:17:57.640 mat Zeus which uh you play zudak you
00:17:59.400 should know how powerful that is and
00:18:00.480 then for our big cat here we got double
00:18:02.440 Noir uh so there's one other big cat and
00:18:04.559 that is exp perly happiness we don't
00:18:06.039 play that but uh exp Noir here is your
00:18:09.600 boss monster so you summon on top of any
00:18:12.080 of your rank two kittens while you have
00:18:14.799 five materials under it or obviously you
00:18:16.400 can use the yeep to rank up into it so
00:18:17.919 there your two way against us in the
00:18:18.799 field so what this card does is while it
00:18:20.360 has five or more materials it's
00:18:22.159 unaffected by your opponent's activated
00:18:23.600 effect so yep immune Towers which is
00:18:25.720 awesome and if it has a pearly level one
00:18:27.480 is material then effect you can detach
00:18:29.600 to Target a card your opponent's field
00:18:31.120 or their graveyard so it's graveyard and
00:18:32.520 field uh affecting you can return that
00:18:34.919 card to the bottom of the deck so
00:18:35.880 premium removal here um and you can see
00:18:37.640 why they get so powerful uh and 28
00:18:39.400 defense it's kind of hard to kill even
00:18:40.480 if you don't have the Buffs from like
00:18:41.520 delicious memory under it and yeah I
00:18:43.200 mean this is this is like your boss
00:18:44.280 monster right cuz if you can summon this
00:18:45.799 with like six materials and turn one
00:18:47.240 thanks to the the field spell draw some
00:18:50.240 cards you have the triple bounce with an
00:18:51.760 immune guy so you can you don't it's
00:18:53.240 really hard to force out these bounces
00:18:54.559 you they can't just like SP and force
00:18:56.320 you to chain you can just sit there or
00:18:58.120 like some deck out this period you could
00:18:59.480 have sit on this for the entire game and
00:19:00.480 they have no outs to it so very strong
00:19:02.240 card uh and you can summon two in some
00:19:04.400 game States as well when you go second
00:19:06.080 cuz this can build up five materials
00:19:07.440 really easily and then you still
00:19:08.440 obviously get access to this which
00:19:10.200 builds up materials really easily and
00:19:11.600 then go Bam um so very strong card that
00:19:15.679 doesn't mean what the Pearly engine does
00:19:17.559 uh now it also help you play through the
00:19:18.840 field relinquished Ana and aelia so
00:19:22.200 aelia is your your SP replacement uh
00:19:24.480 this card is been played of the deck
00:19:25.400 until SP came out but it's still very
00:19:27.280 good and just requires
00:19:29.400 uh light or darks and you make it so
00:19:31.760 it's your entire deck which is super
00:19:32.840 easy TI a card on the field and pop it
00:19:34.559 then if you have three or less spells
00:19:35.440 and Grave it kills itself however there
00:19:37.039 shouldn't be a problem in your deck even
00:19:38.400 if it does it's fine just clear through
00:19:39.919 field but play through interrupts cuz
00:19:41.679 pretty much as long as one of your good
00:19:42.679 X seeds connects it's fine and then if a
00:19:44.480 battles you can manage to spell on the
00:19:45.480 grave the pop whatever battles it's kind
00:19:46.799 of cool is obviously better but if you
00:19:48.559 not want to spend 100 bucks this is
00:19:50.159 still a bit pricey it's like 15 but it
00:19:52.159 is the compromise so yes important to
00:19:55.320 note that I forgot about this is if this
00:19:57.320 battles and it dies in the battle it can
00:19:59.120 trigger so sometimes it's good to go
00:20:01.120 like when you have all these up you go
00:20:03.960 like
00:20:05.000 crash this in search one add back three
00:20:08.720 revive uh and you get five cards that
00:20:10.679 way plus the mod C field so you get six
00:20:12.679 cards potentially like because the
00:20:14.880 Pearly can add back and then the ply
00:20:16.120 canel the card as well so you could have
00:20:17.240 seven like that's a seven card exchange
00:20:19.280 so that's often times why just breaking
00:20:20.760 through the field is so important
00:20:21.640 because after there's no interrupts left
00:20:23.159 you can explode really easily going
00:20:24.960 second because of crashing and how how
00:20:26.880 this card Works uh the only link I play
00:20:28.520 is is the protector of the agent's Moon
00:20:30.240 so this C has two fairies and then you
00:20:31.679 attribute a fairy to pop a card on the
00:20:33.200 field uh so your your pees are fairies
00:20:35.360 that's why it mattered now this card is
00:20:37.760 not great but the reason to play it is
00:20:39.480 because skill drain this card is a cost
00:20:41.960 uh this de does have a problem with
00:20:42.880 skill drain but if you get two fairies
00:20:44.000 in the field you can tribute itself to
00:20:45.640 pop skill drain so this is just your way
00:20:47.520 to playing around skill drain there you
00:20:48.960 do need an answer otherwise you'll just
00:20:50.080 sit there at your opponent's Mercy the
00:20:51.120 entire time and that's not okay and then
00:20:52.679 four rank one's got Sprite princess
00:20:54.600 Sprite so attach one Middle top card
00:20:56.679 deck if it's a spell trap add it to your
00:20:57.880 hand which is like like fine for
00:20:59.039 extending plays in weird game States
00:21:00.880 more importantly it's 1,00 attack so in
00:21:02.840 games where you're playing through your
00:21:03.679 Fields you can make this attack over SP
00:21:06.000 and then make Zeus uh on top which is
00:21:07.840 kind of cool uh or you can make n Andale
00:21:10.240 which attacks directly and can't be
00:21:11.640 destroy by battle or card effects yeah
00:21:13.520 or can't be destroyed or targeted that's
00:21:14.919 what it does uh and then it's just more
00:21:16.559 Zeus fodder and then just tempai is fine
00:21:18.240 as well and then Zeus is obviously
00:21:19.679 broken and then Downer cuz they all you
00:21:21.919 know line up with downard and then a
00:21:23.880 deck where you get like four mat six mat
00:21:25.520 Zeus's off really easily then yeah I
00:21:27.240 mean obviously this card this Bon
00:21:29.400 uh like there's the point where you can
00:21:30.440 argue playing two but in reality you
00:21:32.320 don't need to like your your extra deck
00:21:33.760 is kind of tight so that's the deck I
00:21:35.520 hope you got a good understanding of how
00:21:36.919 the deck operates I don't know if you've
00:21:38.159 already played pearly or seen a played
00:21:39.559 before it may have been uh too much of a
00:21:41.320 simplification of what things do but I
00:21:43.200 do I do want to like urge this is a
00:21:44.840 great deck for beginners because I think
00:21:46.400 it is not super simple now I mean that
00:21:48.120 could also be a reason not for beginners
00:21:49.880 but if you're trying to get better at
00:21:51.039 the game and you have a base basic grasp
00:21:53.400 on fundamentals I think this is where
00:21:55.240 you want to go cuz it will challenge you
00:21:57.080 it will improve your critical thinking
00:21:58.720 your resource management and it's still
00:22:00.919 good now barrier will suck to play
00:22:02.640 against unfortunately I think only Decks
00:22:04.200 that can play well against barrier are
00:22:05.440 like snake eye and that's pretty much it
00:22:08.559 uh they all every other loses the
00:22:09.960 barrier is bad yeah while this is not
00:22:12.120 perfect it does have a lot of strengths
00:22:14.120 and I recommend you guys to pick it up
00:22:16.600 now I'm going to show you what the deck
00:22:18.360 looks like price-wise all right so I've
00:22:20.159 now pulled up on TCG player and you can
00:22:22.240 see here I got I don't know why I have
00:22:23.919 58 items in my cart I think maybe I
00:22:25.600 misclicked and I have a couple extra
00:22:27.559 cards but the price here this is
00:22:29.520 including Staples by the way if you're
00:22:30.640 starting from scratch is about $115 uh
00:22:33.600 and that is including shipping here so
00:22:35.559 not not too bad it's not under 100 bucks
00:22:38.039 and I think part of it is like they a
00:22:40.080 little pricey cards like Zeus is a bit
00:22:42.480 uh imperm is a bit and from the last
00:22:44.559 video at least Staples have gone up cuz
00:22:46.080 ready collection uh two didn't reprint
00:22:47.880 as many good Staples another one is
00:22:49.600 fading more Into Obscurity uh or into
00:22:51.960 the into the past some of those Staples
00:22:54.080 are gaining in price of it but this is
00:22:56.520 still viable but either way let's say
00:22:58.720 own your Staples already let's see how
00:23:00.480 much this deck would cost because that
00:23:01.600 that matters a lot of players players
00:23:03.000 who aren't like brand new and have say
00:23:04.840 even the mergen deck from last time
00:23:05.960 let's say you already have effect
00:23:06.840 failers let's say you already have your
00:23:08.279 Zeus let's say you already havea which
00:23:11.320 is a bit pricey it's not nothing say you
00:23:13.600 have an SP already this one is iffy
00:23:15.440 because it's fine but say you already
00:23:17.120 have have aelia say you already have
00:23:19.200 nirus say you have this and I'm going to
00:23:21.440 go and just remove all the cards you can
00:23:22.840 conceivably have right terraforming I
00:23:24.200 expect you to have this and that leaves
00:23:25.760 us with this package here where I got
00:23:27.360 the agent card I don't expect to have
00:23:28.919 that all the Pearly uh ranks the uh
00:23:31.640 pearly spells pearly monsters or XYZ set
00:23:34.799 up between a couple packages here uh and
00:23:37.200 then I'm expect to you a princess brigh
00:23:38.400 or downer even if you do like those are
00:23:39.600 not expensive but yeah let's how much do
00:23:41.279 this cost got seven bucks in shipping I
00:23:43.000 haven't even optimized this yet it could
00:23:44.240 be cheaper but yeah 23 bucks got the
00:23:46.960 shipping if you already have your
00:23:48.000 Staples this deck costs nothing let's
00:23:50.240 see if I optimize it can I get under 20
00:23:51.919 no I canot looks like it's already been
00:23:54.559 optimized uh wait what okay my shipping
00:23:56.720 went up and my cards went down which is
00:23:58.159 funny
00:23:59.000 but yes $23 for this deck is really not
00:24:03.120 bad um if you don't have the Staples
00:24:05.320 save up a bit maybe and you can get
00:24:07.240 there a bit over 100 bucks because aelia
00:24:10.039 maybe not worth it Ana maybe not worth
00:24:11.799 it but like everything else staple wise
00:24:14.000 like Zeus is a phenomenal card uh the
00:24:15.840 hand traps obviously Prosperity very
00:24:17.960 very strong so yeah this deck is not
00:24:21.080 worth a lot so let's go over it this
00:24:23.279 deck is cute you get to play cat deck
00:24:25.520 this deck is pretty solid Against The
00:24:26.880 Meta with its only big weakness being
00:24:28.360 dimensional barrier the deck is really
00:24:30.120 affordable now and the deck is really
00:24:32.080 different than how it plays it requires
00:24:34.559 critical thinking it Fosters and
00:24:37.000 nurtures new skills and players and you
00:24:39.159 can pull off some crazy turns where you
00:24:41.760 get a ton of Vantage really quickly I
00:24:44.039 recommend giving this deck a try and I
00:24:45.440 think if you are a budget player or
00:24:48.320 you're a newer player this is a great
00:24:50.559 next step in your Yu-Gi-Oh career now
00:24:52.880 that brings an end to our pearly
00:24:54.360 discussion I really think this deck is
00:24:55.840 worth picking up it is very affordable
00:24:58.000 very fun and very interesting so hope
00:25:02.480 you guys find so as well and if you want
00:25:05.360 to see how to play out cu you know it's
00:25:07.039 not the most intuitive deck in the world
