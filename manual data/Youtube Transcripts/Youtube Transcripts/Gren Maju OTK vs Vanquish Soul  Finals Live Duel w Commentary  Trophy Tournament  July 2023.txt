00:00:46.379 featuring grin module Kaiju otk versus
00:00:49.559 Vanquish soul
00:00:54.059 TCG
00:00:58.290 [Music]
00:01:00.059 all right diving into our finals game
00:01:02.460 one we are going to see the grin modu
00:01:05.459 Kaiju otk on the left and we're gonna go
00:01:07.920 ahead and see myself on the right this
00:01:09.840 is the finals of your trophy tournament
00:01:11.100 that we hosted so obviously this is uh
00:01:13.799 for the price for about a hundred
00:01:15.240 dollars so we're playing for fun
00:01:16.500 obviously but uh let's see what ends up
00:01:19.680 happening here we go five cards I think
00:01:21.659 that accidentally picked up an extra
00:01:22.920 card and so I was just showing them
00:01:24.119 those five cards I put it right back uh
00:01:26.280 we do see Rhoda in my hand though so
00:01:27.840 that is a good start for us obviously
00:01:30.060 and um let's see how we end up doing so
00:01:33.479 we are going to go ahead and start with
00:01:34.439 a Rhoda Rota should be able to go ahead
00:01:36.420 and grab the raisin
00:01:41.640 Obviously good start for Vancouver Soul
00:01:43.380 player and then we're going to go ahead
00:01:45.060 and what I imagine is normal summon
00:01:47.280 raisin
00:01:49.380 do normal summon raisin raisin effect is
00:01:51.600 then going to go ahead and add that is
00:01:53.460 going to go ahead and grab a Caesar kind
00:01:55.079 of a tell that we already have mad love
00:01:56.579 and Borger in our hand so that just kind
00:01:59.040 of gives three nun cards we're gonna go
00:02:00.420 ahead and Link this off for a rock at
00:02:01.680 the vanquisher
00:02:02.939 we activate rocket the vanquisher effect
00:02:05.340 that should special summon out a Mad
00:02:07.079 Love from our hand
00:02:09.598 mad love effect is then going to go
00:02:10.919 ahead and activate that is going to go
00:02:12.780 ahead and search out a continue
00:02:18.599 and here's where you can continue
00:02:22.319 and then we're going to go ahead and
00:02:23.340 summon burger by bouncing back the mad
00:02:26.099 love to our hand although actually I see
00:02:28.319 a lot of spells in our hands so it's
00:02:31.200 potentially we don't have Burger but I
00:02:32.520 don't know why we wouldn't search Burger
00:02:33.540 uh we actually go Caesar effect bounce
00:02:36.360 madlib back to our hand and then we go
00:02:38.280 stick your soul reveal the Mad Love and
00:02:41.879 then that's going to go ahead and
00:02:42.660 special out the heavy burger then we get
00:02:45.000 the heavy Burger effect that might have
00:02:46.620 been a little
00:02:49.200 no I didn't I don't know I'd have to
00:02:51.420 think about that played back so we
00:02:53.340 already had mad love in hand
00:02:55.800 uh I guess we still get the same result
00:02:57.300 but we're gonna go ahead and set two
00:03:00.540 and pass and then
00:03:05.280 I think he's just reading our cards
00:03:08.519 uh in Phase stake your soul would bounce
00:03:10.680 the burger back to hand I don't know if
00:03:12.540 that's what they're reading yep
00:03:15.000 uh so the two set we know that one is
00:03:16.680 continue it's possible that the other
00:03:18.060 one was dust devil I think that we did
00:03:19.319 say that we had that so we are going to
00:03:21.120 go ahead and see a draw here
00:03:24.720 I think this is the first time maybe
00:03:26.159 seeing Baker's Soul he did read quite a
00:03:28.200 bit of my cards this was a great matchup
00:03:30.239 though oh also uh please um go check out
00:03:32.819 Johnny's Pizza in Ocean City Maryland
00:03:34.620 where our hunter on the left hosts
00:03:37.140 tournaments you can be right by the
00:03:38.340 beach side and you can go ahead and play
00:03:40.560 in some tournaments eat some pizza write
00:03:42.239 down in Ocean City Maryland not too far
00:03:44.040 from us we obviously are on the East
00:03:45.840 Coast so uh it's not too far so if
00:03:47.879 you're down the Ocean City Maryland look
00:03:49.200 up Johnny's Pizza where Hunter does host
00:03:51.180 Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments so I want to make
00:03:53.220 sure to shout him out uh if Johnny wants
00:03:55.319 to comment down below and comment down
00:03:57.599 his Facebook page or something like that
00:03:58.860 feel free
00:03:59.940 more than welcome
00:04:01.680 so obviously he is uh reading the cards
00:04:04.140 making sure that you know time is of the
00:04:07.379 essence that's all I'm gonna say right
00:04:09.840 uh so let's see what he decides to do
00:04:11.819 here it looks like he's holding a kaiju
00:04:14.280 just Kaiju off the rock of the
00:04:15.720 vanquisher right uh all right just get
00:04:17.940 rid of the Caesar it's not a bad call
00:04:19.380 either so he goes ahead and special
00:04:20.940 summons out the gadarla he puts it in
00:04:23.340 the other link Zone and then he goes
00:04:24.840 ahead and specials out a fin rear fender
00:04:26.699 is a good card
00:04:28.500 uh level seven versus eight if this card
00:04:30.479 was level eight could you imagine
00:04:32.880 otk with the cashier stuff like being
00:04:36.000 having access to good uh
00:04:39.259 gublion and numeron dragon it would just
00:04:42.540 be insane so we are going to go continue
00:04:44.520 continue go ahead and special back to
00:04:46.080 reason we do want to pop get rid of
00:04:48.000 finra here so we're gonna go ahead and
00:04:49.740 fin rear effect we're gonna reveal a
00:04:52.259 fire and a dark and we're gonna go ahead
00:04:53.699 and just pop the fin rear before he gets
00:04:55.860 the effect to add
00:04:57.300 uh so we're bypassing the effect to
00:04:59.400 search and all we're basically passing
00:05:02.040 that up and we're just going to go ahead
00:05:03.240 and use the effect to pop because you
00:05:06.360 can't do both in the same chain it's
00:05:07.919 actually written on the card some people
00:05:09.540 miss that where it says that you can
00:05:10.860 only activate one per chain so you can't
00:05:13.320 search and pop in the same chain so it
00:05:15.660 has to be in separate chains so if you
00:05:18.000 summon it back you can bypass the effect
00:05:19.500 of search and just go ahead straight for
00:05:21.060 a pop
00:05:23.639 so
00:05:25.560 looks like we are just uh clarifying
00:05:27.780 some things here
00:05:29.639 potentially
00:05:32.639 but we are going to get the effect and
00:05:34.320 that is going to go ahead and pop the
00:05:35.520 fin rear
00:05:38.580 maybe we're just clarifying those maybe
00:05:40.979 we're clarifying that what I just told
00:05:43.199 you guys as far as the search versus pop
00:05:46.320 goes
00:05:48.060 uh so we see an alpha come down next
00:05:50.699 we've played through a Kaiju not played
00:05:52.919 through its owner field still but
00:05:54.479 obviously we couldn't not let this Kaiju
00:05:56.460 or this Alpha bounce that Kaiju back to
00:05:58.199 hand so the thing with Alpha is Alpha
00:06:01.620 will balance the Kaiju back to their
00:06:03.060 hand they can summon the alpha again and
00:06:06.120 then they could Kaiju your field again
00:06:07.680 so we have to dust devil this Alpha
00:06:09.840 there's no choice as far as that goes
00:06:11.759 because uh you want to book it before it
00:06:14.160 gets the chance to bounce that Kaiju
00:06:15.660 because then the Kaiju will just Kaiju
00:06:17.220 over your rock in the vanquisher OR
00:06:18.600 Kaiju over your raisin
00:06:20.759 and you basically just down a card so
00:06:22.800 you deal with it by just getting rid of
00:06:24.600 it with the alpha or with the dust devil
00:06:26.520 uh we do special summon a good darling
00:06:28.560 to our field so another level eight
00:06:30.840 obviously gets us some rank eight plays
00:06:34.979 let's see where he decides to go with he
00:06:37.199 is going to go with a gizmet so he does
00:06:38.580 have access to it I wonder if we've
00:06:40.319 played through all of our interruptions
00:06:41.580 potentially uh these have higher defense
00:06:45.060 than 2 000 or I guess than raisin so
00:06:49.199 uh dealing with our Caesar is pretty
00:06:50.940 impactful too
00:06:54.240 obviously the Kaiju on it
00:06:56.759 so he's obviously looking into going to
00:06:58.979 for some rank 8 plays I would imagine
00:07:02.819 like I said usually you see the
00:07:03.960 dragoobly online here
00:07:11.400 let's see what he decides to do
00:07:14.280 so he does go for a dragublion
00:07:17.160 uh we're just reading this I think that
00:07:19.199 what I was looking to do here was
00:07:21.539 possibly
00:07:23.759 um
00:07:24.599 bouncing it because it has zero defense
00:07:27.120 so I was actually trying to see if I
00:07:28.440 could mad love someone out and if I mad
00:07:30.479 love somebody out then I could go ahead
00:07:32.099 and just bounce it back to hand
00:07:33.840 uh but we are gonna go heavy Burger
00:07:35.280 heavy Burger Target the raisin
00:07:38.160 and we're gonna try to get a draw here
00:07:39.780 maybe try to dig for a card that can
00:07:41.880 deal with the otk and also
00:07:45.780 with the heavy Burger up reveal mad love
00:07:48.180 to draw uh with the heavy burger and the
00:07:50.280 rock of the vanquisher he can only
00:07:52.380 attack the gadarla that's really
00:07:53.759 important in this encounter because if
00:07:55.380 sometimes they think that they can
00:07:56.400 attack wherever they want but they can
00:07:58.199 only attack the good darling here and uh
00:08:00.840 that's because it has the highest attack
00:08:02.520 and that's what rock of the vanquisher
00:08:03.780 says so
00:08:05.039 you know Hunter he was this was
00:08:06.419 obviously a couple weeks ago so the the
00:08:08.340 cards were still fairly new we were
00:08:10.139 testing for gnats so I'm just not
00:08:11.520 getting to actually commentating over
00:08:12.900 the video but the banker Soul was fairly
00:08:14.880 new at this point so he didn't realize
00:08:16.259 that with rocking the vanquisher up and
00:08:18.360 another vanquished Soul monster on the
00:08:19.680 field he can only attack the monster
00:08:21.060 with the highest attack and so I think
00:08:23.699 he does go for the numeron dragon here
00:08:25.560 but he wants to attack the rock of the
00:08:27.479 vanquisher but then I had explained to
00:08:29.099 him that you actually can't attack the
00:08:30.360 rock the van Gogh as long as you have a
00:08:31.620 venker soul monster you actually have to
00:08:33.120 attack the Darla here
00:08:36.779 so he does in fact go for the numeron
00:08:40.500 dragon attaching it looks like a hope
00:08:42.000 Harbinger to it
00:08:43.380 uh actually it's the ghost Galaxy eyes
00:08:45.300 photon dragon I believe it is Neo Galaxy
00:08:47.220 photon dragon that card can attack up to
00:08:49.680 a number of xyz's in the field or
00:08:51.300 something like that it's kind of crazy
00:08:52.860 uh so he goes no run Dragon we are going
00:08:54.540 to go ahead and activate the effect of
00:08:56.459 rock of the vanquisher
00:09:01.080 I think that what we're trying to do is
00:09:02.640 actually get a play we're able to bounce
00:09:04.560 the dragublion or bounce the numeron
00:09:06.360 dragon back into his extra deck which
00:09:08.399 would be incredible because then he
00:09:09.660 couldn't attack
00:09:12.720 but I think that we're missing the Earth
00:09:14.940 and that is our problem here because
00:09:16.440 Rock the Bengal shark can only add back
00:09:18.000 to hand from grave or special summon it
00:09:19.680 can't do both in the same turn
00:09:22.800 so
00:09:24.540 and looking here at what we're gonna do
00:09:31.860 let's see we're a big thinking obviously
00:09:34.440 he is gonna go we're actually choosing
00:09:36.600 not to use any effect so he goes numeron
00:09:38.100 Dragon effect and I'm explaining to him
00:09:40.260 that same thing that you can only attack
00:09:41.339 the guitarla so he does battle into the
00:09:43.260 gadarla and I think it's at 9 000 attack
00:09:45.779 so I do take quite a bit here I think I
00:09:47.880 take about 6 500.
00:09:51.600 let's see if my math is right okay I'm
00:09:53.160 pretty close there 6300 which is still a
00:09:55.800 good chunk but unfortunately with a
00:09:57.779 grand module otk once you've kind of
00:09:59.519 gone past your turn you're really left
00:10:01.200 with no resources so here we can just go
00:10:03.420 ahead and normal summon out the raisin
00:10:05.100 raisin can probably grab another Caesar
00:10:06.959 that's what I was thinking and then we
00:10:07.980 could just activate the effect of Raisin
00:10:09.480 to pop the alpha here
00:10:13.200 let's see if that's what we decide to do
00:10:14.760 oh I guess we're rocking the vanquisher
00:10:16.380 summoning and me phase two and then in
00:10:18.899 passing we're gonna draw for turn so we
00:10:21.240 are gonna go Burger effect Burger is
00:10:22.740 going to go ahead and reveal the Matlab
00:10:23.880 draw and then we go raise an effect and
00:10:26.160 we're gonna go raise and reveal the dark
00:10:28.200 and the fire that's gonna go ahead and
00:10:29.519 pop the alpha here
00:10:31.860 and uh Hunter looks a little worried
00:10:33.720 he's grabbing his head here he kind of
00:10:35.640 might know that it's over let's see what
00:10:36.959 happens
00:10:37.920 we go with a normal summon of a Mad Love
00:10:40.380 mad love effect is then going to go
00:10:41.820 ahead and activate
00:10:42.800 and we're gonna go ahead and reveal a
00:10:45.779 darkened Earth that's going to put the
00:10:47.160 numeron dragon back into the extra deck
00:10:48.839 getting rid of another monster
00:10:51.000 probably could have just battled into it
00:10:52.980 to be honest because I think that it
00:10:54.060 loses its attack at the end of its turn
00:10:55.740 then we go Caesar Caesar's gonna go
00:10:57.600 ahead and reveal three dark fire and an
00:11:00.000 earth and that's gonna go ahead and pop
00:11:01.260 the numeron dragon or the drug gublion I
00:11:03.839 apologize
00:11:04.860 and now we switch that to attack and I
00:11:07.079 think this is 55 plus the 18 from raisin
00:11:10.440 close to game and we go rocket the
00:11:13.320 vanquisher summon out the raisin
00:11:15.480 and then we get raise and effect
00:11:17.820 or actually it could be a normal summon
00:11:20.579 if we either way rocket Adventure summon
00:11:22.500 or normal summon
00:11:23.880 but uh that's gonna go ahead and grab a
00:11:26.160 pluton here ironically enough
00:11:29.040 and we go
00:11:32.399 attack here so we have 25 3000 18 and 18
00:11:35.579 that's going to be game
00:11:37.440 with vanquished Soul actually otking the
00:11:40.500 kite Kaiju Gran maju otk deck so
00:11:45.000 now it's a matter of did they make me go
00:11:47.040 first or second and what do we look to
00:11:49.019 do here so moving on in to game number
00:11:52.200 two of our finals match
00:11:55.440 all right heading into our second game
00:11:58.200 of our finals match of our trophy
00:12:00.060 tournament and if you get a chance
00:12:01.200 please consider subscribing if you enjoy
00:12:03.240 content like this obviously being able
00:12:05.279 to see decks like grin module otk pretty
00:12:07.980 great so if you enjoyed this kind of
00:12:09.360 content let me know down below if
00:12:10.500 there's anything I can do better to
00:12:11.640 improve this quality also comment give
00:12:13.680 us some suggestions I would love to
00:12:14.940 improve this because I do enjoy
00:12:16.079 commentating over uh feature matches
00:12:18.360 like this so let's see if our good
00:12:21.000 module player decides to make us go
00:12:22.380 first
00:12:25.079 and it appears that he may have chosen
00:12:27.660 for us to go first so even after you
00:12:30.600 know the misplay there of the numeron
00:12:32.640 jagublion we still see rays in here so
00:12:35.339 raisin is going to be in our deck we're
00:12:37.140 gonna go ahead and act or nine Our Deck
00:12:38.579 in our hand and we go ahead and grab
00:12:40.200 heavy Burger we're gonna go stake your
00:12:41.579 soul reveal the heavy Burger that's
00:12:43.260 gonna go ahead and bring out mad love
00:12:44.399 and then we go mad love effect probably
00:12:46.260 grabbing ourselves out the dust devil
00:12:47.940 again
00:12:50.160 and let's see if that resolves
00:12:52.860 oh I think I see a dimensional barrier
00:12:55.680 in our hand and it appears to be a
00:12:58.440 dimensional barrier you know that's
00:12:59.579 really good against an otk deck that
00:13:01.860 relies on those rank Eights so here
00:13:04.680 we're going to go ahead and grab
00:13:05.399 continue I think we probably grab
00:13:07.980 continue here because we know we have
00:13:09.300 the D barrier if I had to imagine
00:13:12.899 so now we probably go link off the
00:13:15.720 raisin for a rock of the vanquisher and
00:13:17.940 now we can go ahead and Rocket the
00:13:19.560 vanquisher add back the raisin Burger
00:13:21.060 bounce the Mad Love up to our hand and
00:13:23.279 then Burger get a draw so
00:13:26.399 uh looks like we're gonna go ahead and
00:13:27.899 go Potter Prosperity first maybe instead
00:13:31.320 of doing the burger draw we want to dig
00:13:33.300 for six cards which I can understand so
00:13:35.279 we see Ash nib pluton imperme Caesar in
00:13:38.579 another Emperor all really good cards
00:13:40.800 honestly uh Caesar's really good
00:13:42.720 imprim's really good here
00:13:44.519 pluton
00:13:45.959 if we need a fire maybe but obviously
00:13:48.240 can be searched off of uh continue when
00:13:49.980 we bring back raisin if we needed a fire
00:13:52.320 and Ash also does the same justice so I
00:13:54.600 think when I was sitting here I remember
00:13:55.860 saying to myself I think I'm gonna get
00:13:57.480 crushed by an interrupted Kaiju Slumber
00:13:59.279 so I have to grab Ash here even though I
00:14:01.380 wanted to grab Caesar for something told
00:14:04.019 me that an interrupted Kaiju Slumber was
00:14:06.839 coming my way and I needed an ash
00:14:09.000 because if you didn't know you can Ash
00:14:10.079 and interrupted Kaiju somber because
00:14:11.940 it's special summons from the deck all
00:14:14.100 right so we set three we pass our turn
00:14:17.820 um
00:14:18.660 deciding not to bring Out Burgers we
00:14:20.700 should have brought out burger so we
00:14:22.380 could draw in the draw phase that's
00:14:24.120 probably a misplay but again this was
00:14:25.380 early on when I was testing the deck we
00:14:27.420 were still learning how to play the deck
00:14:28.860 but uh even we probably should just
00:14:30.660 summoned Burger
00:14:32.040 um Harpy's feather duster so we're gonna
00:14:34.200 chain continue targeting our raisin and
00:14:37.380 we're gonna chain dimensional barrier
00:14:38.880 calling XYZ so he does hit us with the
00:14:42.060 Harpy's feather duster here really good
00:14:43.380 and uh trap trick being the other card
00:14:45.000 obviously we could have trapped tricked
00:14:46.139 into a dimensional barrier we do get to
00:14:48.060 special summon out the raisin and we
00:14:50.160 will activate raisin's effect
00:14:52.380 and uh let's see what attribute that we
00:14:54.600 need here we do grab a Caesar so
00:14:56.760 grabbing ourselves the Earth
00:15:00.420 and again
00:15:02.100 um
00:15:02.940 probably should have had Burgers set up
00:15:06.000 by now
00:15:07.079 uh product desires he's gonna go ahead
00:15:09.300 and banish tin I mean it's a good thing
00:15:11.279 we grab that Ash obviously uh gonna get
00:15:14.279 the desires met with an ash this is a
00:15:16.800 great for us because uh it's a minus one
00:15:19.079 one for one trade that y'all do all day
00:15:20.760 we do go Burger effect bouncing the Mad
00:15:22.920 Love and then we are gonna go Burger
00:15:24.240 effect here again something that we
00:15:26.519 could have prevented if we would have
00:15:28.199 set up the burger at the by many phase
00:15:30.839 two of our turn but I mean it's fine
00:15:32.579 it's okay
00:15:35.760 so that does bring out the burger
00:15:39.480 uh dimensional barrier has been called
00:15:41.279 that's also something else to think
00:15:42.480 about
00:15:43.199 so he is locked out of being able to go
00:15:46.019 into his XYZ summons
00:15:49.320 I do see what appears to be a gamma Sill
00:15:52.980 and um he is gonna go ahead and get
00:15:55.440 Darla over the raisin here so deciding
00:15:59.160 to give him a silver raisin which is
00:16:02.279 fine
00:16:04.079 I mean Rock of the Vanquish yourself
00:16:05.399 card and then there it is I just had
00:16:08.459 that feeling that he had that in his
00:16:10.380 hand I knew that I was gonna see it and
00:16:13.500 unfortunately I had to ask the desires
00:16:15.540 there's no way that you don't ask the
00:16:16.860 desires right so
00:16:20.459 uh we're gonna chain Rock Rock's gonna
00:16:22.139 add back rays in here and he's gonna go
00:16:24.300 ahead and wipe the floor be able to
00:16:25.620 special something too but he can't otk
00:16:27.779 so we are preventing him from being able
00:16:29.579 to otk by locking him out with the
00:16:31.440 dimensional barrier which is very useful
00:16:33.480 for us but something told me that that
00:16:35.639 interrupted Kaiju Slumber was coming
00:16:38.279 so he summons dogger into his field
00:16:40.199 gamma seal to my field
00:16:43.199 let's see what his other two cards are
00:16:44.639 in hand
00:16:46.199 uh he's gonna have to go to battle phase
00:16:47.880 and he's gonna go ahead and attack into
00:16:49.079 our game of seal again maybe because
00:16:51.060 with a dimensional barrier but he's
00:16:53.100 gonna have to pass and I think it's
00:16:54.420 really bad for him because we obviously
00:16:55.800 have full setups we are going to go
00:16:56.940 ahead normal summon Raisin in the middle
00:16:58.680 Zone and we're going to activate the
00:17:00.180 Effect 2 search probably go out grabbing
00:17:02.339 ourselves a pluton here
00:17:07.380 I guess we have another raisin in hand
00:17:09.119 so no need to go for pluton here we can
00:17:12.000 really go for any attributes we do go
00:17:13.619 for a heavy Burger grabbing ourselves
00:17:15.599 that one and we're going to activate the
00:17:17.280 effect revealing heavy Bergen revealing
00:17:18.839 raisin to pop the dog around and now we
00:17:20.819 just have to clean up and kind of go for
00:17:22.199 game here so let's see if we're able to
00:17:24.240 do that I can't tell what's in his hand
00:17:26.160 I think I see a kaiju
00:17:28.140 and maybe something else we go rocket
00:17:29.880 the vanquisher linking off the raisin
00:17:32.100 for Rock of the vanquisher
00:17:36.600 and uh let's see you're thinking about
00:17:38.700 our place here we're going to Rocket
00:17:39.660 Adventure special summon out the Mad
00:17:41.220 Love mad love this time is probably
00:17:42.840 going to grab itself a dust devil which
00:17:45.299 is really good right now because our
00:17:46.679 opponent is down to two cards in hand so
00:17:49.140 that's gonna deal with one of his cards
00:17:51.780 because we don't want them to go for a
00:17:53.460 rank 8 that's ideally what we're trying
00:17:54.780 to prevent them from doing so we go
00:17:55.919 heavy Burger bounce the Mad Love Back to
00:17:58.140 hand and then heavy Burger obviously can
00:18:00.299 get the effect to draw
00:18:03.179 or we might actually burn
00:18:09.120 let's see what we decide to do we do
00:18:10.980 have Caesar and we do have a dark but we
00:18:12.360 are going to choose to draw here maybe
00:18:13.740 trying to dig for another Ash Ash would
00:18:16.140 be really good
00:18:23.460 uh he I am going to go ahead and special
00:18:25.500 out the Pantera then we're gonna go
00:18:27.900 ahead and bounce the Pantera back to
00:18:29.340 hand to special summon out the Caesar
00:18:31.740 and then we're gonna go ahead and
00:18:34.559 battle phase we're gonna attack for 3000
00:18:36.720 with the Caesar 25 with the burger and
00:18:40.320 if we would have just burned for game we
00:18:42.840 would have had games so we uh instead of
00:18:44.640 drawing off our Burger we could have
00:18:46.020 burned for 15 and then stand by phase of
00:18:47.700 the next turn burned and uh we probably
00:18:49.559 could have prevented any of this turn
00:18:51.000 from happening but again those are
00:18:53.220 things that you realize after the fact
00:18:54.539 we do get Burger effect to draw here
00:18:58.200 again choosing to draw over burn he's
00:19:01.020 gonna go ahead and banish the
00:19:01.919 interrupted Kaiju Slumber that's going
00:19:03.240 to go ahead and add a Kaiju I did forget
00:19:04.740 about the interrupted Kaiju summer being
00:19:06.299 able to add a Kaiju next turn that is
00:19:09.000 pretty impressive and important because
00:19:11.580 that has another card to the hand and
00:19:13.200 obviously can give him another level
00:19:15.120 eight on the field if he already has
00:19:16.320 another Kaiju in his hand so
00:19:18.660 we know that guitarlet is in hand
00:19:22.919 let's see what he decides to go for
00:19:31.380 I just realized that my air conditioner
00:19:33.600 kicked on so I apologize for that
00:19:34.919 humming that you might hear uh usually I
00:19:36.900 kick it off when I do some recording but
00:19:38.340 I just realized it's late it's like two
00:19:39.840 in the morning I'm leaving for gnats in
00:19:41.760 the morning and uh I just need to rock
00:19:43.980 this video out before I leave for Nats
00:19:45.720 so I'm finishing this video and heading
00:19:47.820 to bed and I forgot to kick my air off
00:19:49.380 so I apologize for the humming that you
00:19:51.240 might hear
00:19:52.380 so he's obviously looking at the cards
00:19:54.720 I'm just so excited for knots I can't
00:19:56.820 wait I'm hoping to Top This knots and uh
00:19:59.400 and let's see what we do here so he's
00:20:01.440 gonna game his tail over our Caesar here
00:20:04.919 he decided to put the game until
00:20:07.200 right there we'll be going for an animal
00:20:08.520 play possibly could that be possibly be
00:20:10.559 why
00:20:11.460 we do go rock of the vanquisher add back
00:20:13.200 our Caesar
00:20:19.260 and he's looking through the graveyard
00:20:21.059 here
00:20:22.500 trying to figure out his lines was that
00:20:24.480 a monster reborn spicy
00:20:27.780 so that does give him access to another
00:20:29.760 level eight
00:20:31.380 obviously that's really good for him
00:20:33.840 but I think we have enough to play
00:20:34.980 through his interruptions right so we
00:20:36.240 have a dust devil that's going to book
00:20:37.799 one
00:20:38.640 and then
00:20:39.960 yeah we're instantly going to go ahead
00:20:41.760 and book that Darla here
00:20:44.580 and we know that he has two cards left
00:20:47.100 in hand we're just again whole point
00:20:48.840 right now is preventing him from being
00:20:50.520 able to go into a rank eight and
00:20:53.820 um
00:20:54.480 I think we could still summon Caesar
00:20:57.900 Caesar pop because we have Pantera
00:21:00.360 raisin and mad love so Caesar's just
00:21:03.059 gonna be able to pop and deal with the
00:21:04.140 other card in hand
00:21:05.520 and then if he has one other card on the
00:21:07.080 field that's fine as long as he doesn't
00:21:08.039 have two to go into a rank eight like I
00:21:09.780 said is really what we're trying to
00:21:10.980 prevent here
00:21:12.240 so he's looking through his plays
00:21:15.600 he's looking through the graveyard again
00:21:18.840 you know Hunter would really play well
00:21:20.280 into time I'm just saying
00:21:22.500 you can see me cross arm now just just
00:21:24.660 waiting
00:21:26.160 waiting for a move to be made here so we
00:21:28.500 do summon out another Kaiju
00:21:31.799 and then we just instantly go Caesar
00:21:33.720 bounced the burger back to hand some in
00:21:35.100 the Caesar then we activate the Caesar
00:21:36.780 effect revealing three and just popping
00:21:38.460 it to deal with it so he has one card
00:21:40.080 left in hand
00:21:41.400 that card is not going to be able to get
00:21:43.440 him into a rank 8 play
00:21:46.200 so
00:21:48.120 he does drop the monster reborn does
00:21:50.640 decide to special summon out
00:21:54.000 the Kaiju the big Kaiju I think it's got
00:21:57.419 like 3300 attack and he's gonna go ahead
00:22:00.000 and battle into our Caesar
00:22:03.120 and that's gonna head over it let's see
00:22:04.380 how much damage we take
00:22:05.940 I think it's got 300 yeah so 3300
00:22:08.580 attacks pretty big guy but unfortunately
00:22:10.980 we draw for turn and we know we have
00:22:12.600 full engine setup so all we have to do
00:22:13.919 is just normal summon raisin raisin
00:22:15.780 effect is going to go ahead and activate
00:22:16.919 we can go ahead and add a card from our
00:22:19.460 deck to our hand here we're gonna go
00:22:22.740 ahead and grab a copy of Caesar we
00:22:24.179 activate the effect revealing a dark and
00:22:26.100 revealing a fire oh maybe we forgot to
00:22:28.799 grab a fire so we rocked the vanquisher
00:22:30.240 add back of fire here now we activate
00:22:32.039 the effect revealing a fire in the dark
00:22:33.600 we pop that card we know that the booked
00:22:36.059 is a good Darla we do Caesar effects
00:22:39.480 it's gonna go ahead and Pop That
00:22:41.100 and I think from here we can just swing
00:22:43.080 in for a game
00:22:45.240 we normal summon
00:22:47.039 reason and yeah that's it we are gonna
00:22:49.620 take it so Vanquish soul with hand traps
00:22:52.320 gonna actually win this trophy
