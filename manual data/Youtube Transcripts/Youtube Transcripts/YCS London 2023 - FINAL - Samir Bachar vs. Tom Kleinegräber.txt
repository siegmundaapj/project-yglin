00:00:21.660 ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
00:00:24.840 Grand Final of ycs 250 London 2023 Samir
00:00:31.560 is here and Tom his opponent kashtira
00:00:35.579 Sprite the Journey of Visa star Frost
00:00:39.000 concludes in the photon hypernova here
00:00:42.360 in London as Tom begins with the special
00:00:46.320 Summoner fener Alberto what an
00:00:48.420 incredible journey it's been I mean we
00:00:51.539 have Samir who shouldn't even have been
00:00:53.820 here he told us yesterday it was not
00:00:56.699 prepared to come to London and then here
00:00:59.399 is sitting on the final with his Sprite
00:01:01.320 deck and I mean it's been an incredible
00:01:04.559 journey is it's faced a lot of different
00:01:06.900 opponents and then here he started
00:01:09.659 things off with the Sprint let's see if
00:01:12.119 Thomas any response to this
00:01:14.280 this is the best start that Samir could
00:01:16.979 hope for here of course he is playing
00:01:18.299 the cashier cards as well that was my
00:01:19.740 mistake he is indeed going to normal
00:01:21.600 summon the melfi to be able to link into
00:01:24.420 the Sprint here sending the Nimble
00:01:26.759 angler from the deck to the Grave
00:01:27.960 special summoning two uh beavers from
00:01:31.439 the deck
00:01:33.060 absolutely and we mentioned the house
00:01:34.979 Pride was one of the decks in the top
00:01:37.140 eight the remaining but samir's version
00:01:40.140 is quite unique with three copies of
00:01:42.780 swap frogs and as you mentioned
00:01:55.280 just one Nibiru in Tom deck wow the
00:01:58.439 question is have the Stars Ally okay
00:02:01.079 book of eclipse chained this is going to
00:02:04.020 keep the uh gigantic Sprite on the field
00:02:07.380 as the nibir does not uh tribute face
00:02:10.679 down monsters
00:02:14.580 now I don't think this is going to uh
00:02:17.700 exactly do too much but it's it's
00:02:21.000 definitely a nice catch from the French
00:02:24.420 player
00:02:26.220 because obviously it doesn't matter if
00:02:27.900 you face down it's gonna still resolve
00:02:32.700 all right well that is an absolutely
00:02:34.800 incredible catch there as you mentioned
00:02:36.599 from Samir so that uh activating the
00:02:38.940 effect of the gigantic Express in
00:02:40.500 response uh using the Nibiru and because
00:02:43.200 we're chaining uh the book of eclipse
00:02:45.540 because uh the way that gigantic Sprite
00:02:47.819 works it has to detach a material as an
00:02:50.160 effect not as part of a cost and so that
00:02:52.379 way we still get to keep extending yeah
00:02:54.300 great catch but at the same time maybe
00:02:57.120 kind of uh unfortunate play from Tom
00:03:00.420 because he could have just used it on
00:03:01.980 the salmon avoiding this interaction but
00:03:05.160 very well caught out by Samir not a
00:03:07.920 surprise he is a former European
00:03:10.080 Champion already came close to winning a
00:03:12.360 ycs and now in the finals
00:03:15.420 yeah no that Nibiru oh right that is
00:03:18.540 that is a good start here we've got the
00:03:20.819 I think was that a starter he's our two
00:03:22.680 set cards yeah and in the end phase this
00:03:24.959 should be flipped up yeah no I don't
00:03:28.500 know because it's the only opponents
00:03:30.239 right yeah okay all right just making
00:03:33.420 sure that that's how that works and uh
00:03:35.280 yeah so the Nibiru Primal being is uh do
00:03:37.440 you think there's a little bit about a
00:03:38.580 conflict maybe with the cashier engine
00:03:40.080 definitely interesting but the reason is
00:03:42.000 Tom is May the crossout designators so
00:03:44.879 usually the Nibiru is a way for him to
00:03:48.420 avoid getting me period but he did draw
00:03:51.239 into the one copy and that's exactly how
00:03:53.900 it can work sometimes so all right well
00:03:56.940 it isn't going to matter too much in
00:03:58.560 this scenario because the perfect way to
00:04:00.000 continue playing through this is the
00:04:01.500 kashtira birth
00:04:03.060 and I think assuming from the way Samir
00:04:05.700 played this out he should have this
00:04:08.099 measure being set on the field because
00:04:09.360 he had a starter with the jet so
00:04:13.140 Maybe
00:04:14.280 he's holding that
00:04:15.840 yeah no it's uh it's an incredible uh
00:04:18.600 back and forth that we've already seen
00:04:20.040 here just in the first turn here and uh
00:04:23.160 yeah the question is how much has Samir
00:04:24.840 managed to set up here alongside uh that
00:04:28.320 Nibiru Primal being token that came down
00:04:30.900 from uh from Tom the kashtira ogre
00:04:33.840 getting to search a cashier a trap card
00:04:36.240 from the deck that is going to get big
00:04:38.580 bang
00:04:44.040 all right well we're trying to find a
00:04:45.840 way to uh continue through here we also
00:04:47.880 have apotheosis
00:04:50.460 that's a fantastic way to keep extending
00:04:52.320 here targeting the ogre and in response
00:04:54.540 is Samir going to
00:04:56.699 use this Mashers if it's there as
00:04:58.860 Alberto was mentioning let's see
00:05:02.580 because we already seen Samir against
00:05:04.199 Ryan activating this measure when the
00:05:06.419 theosis was activated from his opponent
00:05:08.340 but he has the ash Blossom Ash Blossom
00:05:10.320 comes down
00:05:12.740 in response has as you mentioned yeah
00:05:16.560 he's playing the crossouts in the main
00:05:17.880 deck that was uh ideally supposed to
00:05:20.220 negate any sort of disruption that
00:05:21.900 you're doing he does have this Masters
00:05:24.240 and here he comes from Samir in chain
00:05:28.320 yeah so uh the Smashers here's is going
00:05:30.840 to uh on resolution banish a level two
00:05:33.840 from his fear getting rid of the uh
00:05:36.060 Sprite blue and of course the ogre the
00:05:39.660 FiOS is not gonna resolve but now it's
00:05:43.020 down to Tom whether he has an option to
00:05:45.660 continue and at the very least he's
00:05:47.699 gonna be able to use the second effect
00:05:49.680 of the birth getting this ogre back if
00:05:52.259 he has nothing else for him and just
00:05:56.539 some of his monsters
00:05:59.699 all right well uh going to the battle
00:06:01.500 phase and clearing here would be pretty
00:06:03.840 strong there's a kind of touched upon
00:06:06.840 this a little bit before and that's uh
00:06:08.160 the follow-up of sprite I mean a little
00:06:10.620 bit lacking here isn't it yeah
00:06:11.820 definitely is at the same time we know
00:06:14.220 there is a starter so at the very worst
00:06:16.620 case that's enough to just keep playing
00:06:18.720 through but it seems like he did enter
00:06:20.880 battle phase yep
00:06:27.360 banishing from the top of the attack
00:06:28.620 with the effect of the ogre yeah
00:06:34.560 that was the very top cards that he gets
00:06:36.720 to remove their yeah banishing the yeah
00:06:38.699 you accelerated the top five and you
00:06:40.380 just banish one of them face down
00:06:42.900 but then you don't get to change the
00:06:44.819 order of the rest that would have been a
00:06:46.380 little too strong so yeah it does get to
00:06:48.780 uh still remain and keep the knowledge
00:06:50.880 of what samira's top decking here so it
00:06:54.180 is something to consider but uh yeah Tom
00:06:56.400 Norton that great of a position here oh
00:06:58.560 okay sitting in the same column all
00:07:00.780 right yeah and uh okay I think he
00:07:03.240 noticed that because he's gonna use the
00:07:04.680 same column we need to use this in the
00:07:06.180 end phase
00:07:07.560 I mean yeah at the same time I didn't
00:07:09.720 have an effect monster so it was safe
00:07:12.300 regardless but might as well use it here
00:07:14.520 and uh
00:07:15.960 let's see so as we mentioned the token
00:07:19.319 by the way uh it's only 1400 as it only
00:07:22.560 got to Tribute to the Sprint
00:07:25.560 so resolving this in the end phase and
00:07:27.900 Samir is going to uh well proceed to
00:07:30.840 turn three and try and capitalize on the
00:07:33.599 decent start we had here Tom has put in
00:07:36.300 a lot of work to try and pick apart what
00:07:37.919 he's set up but I think uh it's now time
00:07:41.039 for Samir to mount an offensive
00:07:44.340 in this situation
00:07:46.139 because Samir now uh with this play
00:07:48.479 might also be considering going for the
00:07:51.240 mosquito play
00:07:52.560 yeah that's some big monsters in attack
00:07:54.180 mode yep so there's any Bureau so I
00:07:56.580 could consider that
00:08:06.120 okay so as we can see here it gets to
00:08:08.880 activate his birth banishing free and at
00:08:12.539 the same time he gets a card once it
00:08:14.400 resolves since of course Samir activated
00:08:16.620 as well that's the secondary or rather
00:08:19.460 tertiary effect of the birth so you get
00:08:21.960 to banish some cars from the graveyard
00:08:24.240 I mean there's a lot of tools in his
00:08:25.680 deck just in the main here to be able to
00:08:27.840 uh you know deal with a field like this
00:08:30.240 after the top of the deck were shuffled
00:08:31.680 we don't actually know what the top uh
00:08:33.000 is anymore after the shuffling of the
00:08:34.380 starter there so the ogre effect isn't
00:08:36.000 going to uh be relevant per se let's see
00:08:38.700 what he picked oh it looked like a
00:08:39.839 fenrir I think or was that from the
00:08:41.458 previous yeah it was for the previous
00:08:42.659 turn you picked up maybe a drop yeah
00:08:45.500 all right
00:08:47.880 yeah we're gonna start things off with
00:08:50.040 this jet at the same time of course the
00:08:52.620 cashier ogre is still there
00:08:54.959 so whatever he's gonna be able to
00:08:57.000 excavate again the top five potentially
00:09:00.600 so all things considered in this
00:09:02.279 situation assuming the face down is
00:09:03.899 nothing is mosquito enough here
00:09:06.060 uh it could have been depending on how
00:09:08.580 many monsters but
00:09:10.380 just due to the fact that he said it on
00:09:12.180 the same column maybe that's an
00:09:14.040 impermanence I think it could also be a
00:09:16.680 bluff very well also the biggest band he
00:09:18.899 had it right yeah because the Big Bang
00:09:20.399 was added but uh he's still holding I
00:09:23.339 think a card at least so I'm calling it
00:09:26.700 maybe a bluff if you're if you're Samir
00:09:28.980 but let's see
00:09:32.160 gonna get to add the starter Samir is
00:09:34.500 out of Blues right because one was
00:09:36.000 banished and the other one is in the
00:09:37.200 graveyard right so you cannot get it
00:09:38.820 with the with the last starter let's say
00:09:43.500 canister at Big Bang is an uh underrated
00:09:46.080 card on the field that has a very good
00:09:47.820 effect that allows you to banish uh
00:09:49.560 Monsters uh when your opponent
00:09:51.899 um to sort of equalize the same number
00:09:53.519 of monsters but we cannot fulfill the
00:09:55.680 condition of that because we did not
00:09:56.940 establish a cashier XC on the field so
00:09:59.220 yeah I think uh Samir unless he's really
00:10:02.580 anticipating a uh
00:10:05.519 okay it's Samir having a laugh by having
00:10:07.860 his monster reborn banish the face down
00:10:10.580 really one of the few if not the only
00:10:13.080 players we have seen this weekend
00:10:14.279 playing that card
00:10:16.260 well monster reborn is uh part of a long
00:10:20.279 Legacy of amazing Staples in Samir he
00:10:23.399 had to uh he had to put on his deck you
00:10:25.380 know knowing the way that he deck builds
00:10:26.700 he loves yeah those classic cards and
00:10:29.160 yeah unorthodox approach the deck
00:10:30.839 building it's completely uh been a great
00:10:34.019 payoff for him throughout this
00:10:35.339 tournament he's managed to make it all
00:10:36.899 the way to the final in a Sprite variant
00:10:39.060 that I think maybe potentially isn't the
00:10:41.459 most popular you know we've seen so much
00:10:42.959 runic this weekend haven't we exactly I
00:10:45.120 mean we have seen a lot of different
00:10:46.200 version of sprite this weekend and we
00:10:47.820 said that this was pre previously you
00:10:49.620 know more popular maybe it was yesterday
00:10:51.360 on with especially it goes like Samir
00:10:53.040 his own swap frogs which we haven't seen
00:10:54.839 so far this weekend so it's totally
00:10:56.160 awesome as well
00:10:57.540 still haven't used as for frog in the
00:11:00.240 two matches there we've had the pleasure
00:11:02.279 to have him here but it seems like he's
00:11:04.920 out of the nimbles so at this point he's
00:11:07.260 gonna just try his best with this
00:11:08.940 gigantic
00:11:11.040 I think you've also got battle face yeah
00:11:12.720 and then in Memphis to go downward into
00:11:14.399 Zeus
00:11:15.480 interesting yeah
00:11:18.320 permanence wow
00:11:22.440 that's pretty devastating we're gonna
00:11:23.940 lose our attack that we gain from
00:11:26.160 gigantic Express remember doubles the
00:11:27.779 attack points of itself as it has an
00:11:30.120 extra deck monsters material but the
00:11:31.440 negate of inferminence brings him down
00:11:33.540 to be smaller than Nibiru yeah brutal
00:11:37.860 turn here as mentioned Samir might have
00:11:40.500 predicted this impermanence but
00:11:42.180 unfortunately he just hoped that it was
00:11:44.640 gonna be a bluff and I think now he's in
00:11:47.519 a really tough spot nadir as you
00:11:49.740 mentioned one of the dumb sides of this
00:11:51.720 deck is just playing if you're a board
00:11:54.600 if you're you know whatever you have
00:11:56.160 going on gets a rid of but let's see
00:11:59.220 let's see the factory at least
00:12:01.440 last line of defense to stay in this
00:12:04.500 let's not activate the the effect of the
00:12:07.079 fan rear to get a search here is we're
00:12:08.339 only playing two copies of it I was
00:12:10.079 hoping maybe you know there's a little
00:12:11.519 bit of a benefit it's the uh a battle
00:12:14.220 face has taken place with the nyximos
00:12:15.839 but no way to extend and try and
00:12:17.820 establish this despite that in main
00:12:19.200 phase two and so Tom is gonna go uh
00:12:21.300 directly to the battle phase here it
00:12:22.560 looks like with the normal summon of the
00:12:24.180 fenrir with the birth
00:12:26.399 and here Sameer just trying to survive
00:12:28.680 because he's buying himself some time
00:12:31.560 because otherwise this would have been a
00:12:33.720 lot
00:12:34.620 yeah but what are you even trying to go
00:12:37.800 for at this stage
00:12:40.560 jet as a Target here might potentially
00:12:43.139 uh have we been through three starters
00:12:45.420 at this stage yeah I think so so maybe
00:12:47.279 the double cross could be the only one
00:12:49.680 let's see
00:12:51.000 here as mentioned birth is gonna just go
00:12:54.000 and banish three more cars from his
00:12:56.100 graveyard
00:12:58.440 birth is just an incredible car that has
00:13:00.899 so much utility and versatility to be
00:13:02.579 able to remove cars from the graveyard
00:13:03.720 uh using it at the start of the turn
00:13:05.459 here to perform a normal summon of a
00:13:06.779 level seven without tributing and of
00:13:08.519 course the most important fact is every
00:13:09.720 turn you can bring back something from
00:13:12.120 your Graver Banner Zone yeah and we do
00:13:14.700 see the third copy of starter from Samir
00:13:17.940 not sure if he's even gonna be able to
00:13:20.100 get uh there so let's see
00:13:24.120 all right Tom is making quick work of
00:13:26.399 samir's field here as we're putting oh
00:13:28.560 okay oh yeah you're right I mean so he
00:13:31.019 doesn't want to uh lose the banish here
00:13:33.959 just so that he can uh keep his life
00:13:36.120 points as much intact as possible and
00:13:38.220 again we're gonna see the top five yeah
00:13:41.459 there
00:13:42.470 [Applause]
00:13:44.240 all right well Samir has unfortunately
00:13:48.180 uh been defeated in this round despite
00:13:51.000 the fact that he got to go first he must
00:13:53.220 be really kicking himself absolutely
00:13:54.959 yeah the British move for semi-finals
00:13:57.959 I'll do against a dear friend of him in
00:14:00.660 Ryan jabri but now it's the first time
00:14:03.360 that we have seen him losing while going
00:14:05.579 first and this is obviously very
00:14:07.740 worrying considering everything but that
00:14:11.220 one copy of Nibiru drawn by Tom really
00:14:14.519 surprised the French player and can't
00:14:17.040 blame him he still kept his composure
00:14:18.839 try to play through with book of eclipse
00:14:20.820 but now it's just a game we must be
00:14:24.120 focused on the remainings and nothing is
00:14:26.279 sure yet we have seen a lot of comebacks
00:14:29.100 even in the finals so what do we think
00:14:32.279 Samir is gonna do now that he approaches
00:14:34.440 his side deck well Samir does have to
00:14:36.839 try and reverse sweep here but yeah with
00:14:38.639 the option of uh going first yet again
00:14:41.220 he has some options in the in the inside
00:14:43.560 that cure taking a look here you know
00:14:45.620 grave of the super ancient organism he
00:14:48.060 plays one of that that could potentially
00:14:49.199 come in anti-spells and uh one of drone
00:14:52.320 lockbird as well the way I do love them
00:14:55.040 exactly the ratios that Samir does it's
00:14:58.019 well yeah it works it works funny enough
00:15:01.139 both players are using a lot of one-offs
00:15:03.920 Tommy is using crossout designator to
00:15:06.899 justify them Samir is just confident and
00:15:09.959 he gets there but I really want to see
00:15:12.120 these swap frogs maybe a totally awesome
00:15:13.980 plus an anti-spell could be enough on
00:15:17.279 the other hand though uh Tom is gonna
00:15:19.440 adapt this deck and he has a lot of
00:15:21.899 interesting cars for especially going
00:15:23.699 second yeah he has so many he has he has
00:15:26.100 the gamma so that very very powerful as
00:15:28.380 well and then he has all the one us for
00:15:30.600 the crossout as well so he has lightning
00:15:32.160 storm feather duster the ash Blossom as
00:15:34.920 well so he has a lot of different and
00:15:36.839 also the triple tactics to us he really
00:15:38.459 wants to so it's a lot of different ones
00:15:40.920 so it's not going to be easy for Samir
00:15:42.660 but maybe this time time I will go first
00:15:44.760 and the totally awesome will come up
00:15:47.339 do you think Dimension shifter is worth
00:15:49.019 bringing in going second for Tom I mean
00:15:51.060 honestly uh it is okay I mean in my
00:15:54.720 opinion the deck can play Under shifter
00:15:56.699 but uh it's it's not great I mean it's
00:15:58.860 uh honestly I used to play shifter in uh
00:16:02.000 it's bright and yeah especially because
00:16:04.079 this is not runick's product so it's
00:16:06.240 even worse uh in this case and at the
00:16:09.300 same time though it will be interesting
00:16:10.920 to see Samir probably has no idea that
00:16:13.560 his opponent is only one Nibiru you
00:16:15.540 might be thinking oh he's made in free
00:16:17.100 nibiru's you know and now he's gonna
00:16:18.420 play even more conservatively around
00:16:19.980 that when he doesn't really need to you
00:16:21.600 know just uh exactly but we'll see
00:16:24.720 regardless our Duelists are ready so
00:16:27.660 let's get into this game show of the
00:16:30.060 finals
00:16:38.670 [Music]
00:16:42.320 Samir winning the dice roll in game one
00:16:44.940 and faltering despite that so has
00:16:47.519 another chance to redeem himself here
00:16:49.259 and see if he can do anything like his
00:16:52.380 game plan was set out to do turn one
00:16:55.500 and looking promising I saw a starter
00:16:58.259 and a blue yeah let's see
00:17:02.699 all right that's a normal Summoner level
00:17:04.140 two and a special summon of Blues so uh
00:17:06.240 can't complain too much We're Off to the
00:17:08.160 Races here yeah there's again there is
00:17:10.799 the gamma
00:17:13.459 this is very very powerful because
00:17:15.780 basically now you're able to stop the
00:17:17.520 blue uh we saw Samir having both the
00:17:20.400 starter and the triple tactic Talent as
00:17:22.559 well
00:17:24.119 yeah I mean Sprite blue is the sort of
00:17:26.099 heart and soul of the Sprite engine it
00:17:27.480 gets you into any other monster which uh
00:17:29.160 you know jet gets you into another spell
00:17:30.660 we've got triple talents and response
00:17:32.580 here but the end is actually looking
00:17:35.880 the weak side outside of this gamma for
00:17:38.100 Tom so this Talent can actually hurt
00:17:40.620 quite a bit what do you think rid of
00:17:42.960 here I mean the gamma window is probably
00:17:45.539 dead unless yeah I mean the driver is
00:17:47.700 most likely to get banished book of moon
00:17:49.020 helps you going second but there's not a
00:17:50.760 lot of engine here and that's exactly
00:17:52.200 what Samir does removing that apotheosis
00:17:54.900 as the extender yeah FiOS is gone and
00:17:57.900 now we see the starter and a huge
00:18:01.200 Round of Applause from our crowd
00:18:03.840 supporting the French player because now
00:18:06.480 you go for the jet and you can take the
00:18:08.160 double cross then you go for the Sprint
00:18:09.900 this is still really strong so it's uh
00:18:12.539 it's super strong yeah you can do pretty
00:18:14.640 much uh the same combos we've seen you
00:18:17.220 can have access to the malfi engine
00:18:18.840 potentially and yeah we get to the
00:18:21.960 Double Cross so this is still looking
00:18:24.299 very promising for Samir as you see he's
00:18:27.480 thinking about whether he should go for
00:18:29.280 the gigantic before or just get into the
00:18:31.500 spring honestly side frame gear gamma is
00:18:34.440 pretty pretty strong against Sprite if
00:18:36.660 we start off with a big powerful normal
00:18:38.039 summon effect because it doesn't just
00:18:39.240 negate it removes the body from the
00:18:40.740 field which means you can't special
00:18:41.760 summon level twos but because Samir
00:18:43.980 actually opened probably one of the
00:18:45.600 worst monsters you want to see in your
00:18:47.039 opening hand really is the Nimble angler
00:18:49.080 but uh you know it's still doing a
00:18:51.299 little bit of work regardless but it
00:18:53.460 seems like Samir is just popping off
00:18:55.260 here with the gigantic Sprite into the
00:18:56.940 carrot and now performing a link summon
00:18:58.620 for that Sprint
00:19:01.200 yeah interesting uh sequence here
00:19:03.840 usually you can go for the other way
00:19:05.700 around going for the Sprint first and
00:19:07.440 then the gigantic so I'm wondering uh
00:19:10.740 what kind of line I mean because like
00:19:12.299 you still get to keep the carrot at the
00:19:14.039 end of it don't you exactly so usually
00:19:16.080 that's why you would go for but uh I
00:19:19.679 mean we saw that I think he's playing
00:19:21.539 two copies of both carrot and spread
00:19:24.360 yeah so he has definitely a unique uh
00:19:26.520 Sprite uh engine we can say but
00:19:30.840 honestly sometimes when you look at your
00:19:33.360 opponent end you know what's enough and
00:19:34.980 you know that your opponent end is very
00:19:36.780 weak relying on this top deck if there
00:19:39.960 is nothing good from Tom we might have a
00:19:42.419 very quick game shoe here
00:19:44.520 so the book of moon the rise heart and
00:19:47.400 the side frame gear gamma with a
00:19:48.660 banished driver so something off the top
00:19:50.820 here has to be really powerful otherwise
00:19:52.559 uh samir's first turn play here looks to
00:19:55.679 be quite convincing we've got the melfi
00:19:57.900 set up with the double cross
00:20:01.260 all right so we're gonna think on the
00:20:02.880 normal summon of the rise heart here it
00:20:05.340 makes sense he's thinking about finally
00:20:07.080 using this melfi caddy and he does
00:20:11.940 yeah I think it makes sense to go for
00:20:13.500 the caddy here
00:20:14.640 because now you also prevent your
00:20:16.919 opponent to continue and then you also
00:20:18.660 have the double crops so
00:20:21.299 so much disruption with just a small
00:20:23.100 engine right the Sprint bounce the
00:20:24.780 double cross and the melfi combo yeah I
00:20:27.059 think he has more than enough for what
00:20:28.679 uh Thomas is holding now absolutely
00:20:30.840 looking Innocent but actually quite
00:20:33.600 deadly combo here that
00:20:36.059 actually okay where
00:20:39.720 so I think we're double checking on the
00:20:41.400 neuron app to see just exactly how the
00:20:43.200 psct works on the melfi category will it
00:20:45.360 still bounce does it actually matter
00:20:46.799 here and I think the way that this I
00:20:49.559 don't think that Tom believed that book
00:20:51.720 of moon worked exactly
00:20:55.020 uh double check that's exactly what
00:20:57.059 you're asking right now so I'm gonna
00:20:58.919 bring it up for you guys as well to read
00:21:01.380 what good car says is that you can
00:21:04.500 return this card to the end and it says
00:21:07.559 yeah this card to the end yeah you can
00:21:09.419 add one beast from your deck
00:21:15.419 so yeah we're just double checking with
00:21:16.980 the judges here to make sure that this
00:21:18.600 card works exactly how the psct uh
00:21:21.059 results here so I I think this should
00:21:23.940 just return to the hand anyway and still
00:21:25.919 resolve yeah I think so
00:21:29.860 [Music]
00:21:31.620 so the multi engine I mean it's a little
00:21:33.360 bit quite unorthodox I suppose to an
00:21:35.820 extent it's been popularized I suppose
00:21:37.799 in the last couple of months here
00:21:38.820 recently in the meantime we can go back
00:21:41.580 to us real quick
00:21:43.919 while we wait for this decision and the
00:21:46.919 appeal from our ad judge obviously I
00:21:50.760 mean it is the finals if you have a
00:21:53.460 doubt about a ruling also there is
00:21:55.380 involved some language barrier because
00:21:57.659 the card is in French it looks like so
00:21:59.820 uh you you really want to make sure that
00:22:01.860 this is the right ruling and as you can
00:22:04.440 see here there goes some of the crowd
00:22:07.320 that is here watching the finals live
00:22:10.820 huge crowd gathered and this might
00:22:13.559 actually play into the pressure but
00:22:15.419 action seems like might be back so we
00:22:20.280 can go
00:22:22.380 and yeah
00:22:26.580 the uh as mentioned unfortunately it uh
00:22:30.539 resolved
00:22:33.539 and so now we're looking at the uh
00:22:35.100 melting of the forest uh text here to uh
00:22:37.620 see if it also negates and uh prevents
00:22:40.620 your opponent from attacking after you
00:22:41.760 activate that caddy here
00:22:44.820 and yeah this is a very unfortunate line
00:22:47.640 from Tom
00:22:49.980 who already was starting with a pretty
00:22:52.080 weekend and relied on a top deck which
00:22:54.299 obviously we don't know yet what that
00:22:56.039 could be but now we could see even an
00:22:59.220 adult potentially
00:23:00.720 from uh from Samir which I think makes
00:23:03.240 sense when there is only one more card
00:23:04.679 that could threaten you let's see yeah
00:23:06.780 that is so adult coming down from Samir
00:23:12.419 do you think it's correct to bounce it
00:23:13.799 here yeah I like it yeah because you
00:23:15.480 protected yeah that's why but the Milky
00:23:17.880 prevents your opponent from activating
00:23:20.100 or attacking after a malefi returns to
00:23:22.200 the hand
00:23:24.000 and now you've just given that top deck
00:23:25.919 an option that's the special summon of
00:23:27.659 the
00:23:28.760 unicorn am I getting the effect of melty
00:23:31.200 of the horse correct yeah no no yeah he
00:23:33.120 cannot attack her and uh yeah yeah well
00:23:36.059 it doesn't matter because it doesn't
00:23:37.440 matter as a result
00:23:39.539 to steal the Unicorn
00:23:41.940 really quick game shoe here and the
00:23:44.580 crowd already going crazy can't blame
00:23:47.340 him it is down to game three we
00:23:50.700 mentioned how this was gonna be a close
00:23:52.679 one and it is indeed a close one but for
00:23:55.980 the third time in this duel finally Tom
00:23:59.400 gets to go first maybe maybe I gotta say
00:24:02.700 maybe because we have seen some cashier
00:24:04.320 player like Ryan we've seen uh yeah a
00:24:06.960 couple of Mind Games have happened
00:24:07.919 throughout this ycs and uh I mean it's
00:24:10.740 just anyone's game at this point Tom has
00:24:12.600 proven that he's a pretty experienced
00:24:15.000 and qualified doors to Pilot this
00:24:16.860 cashier deck well and you know Samir
00:24:19.200 we've also seen him go second yeah no
00:24:20.880 exactly but also as you mentioned as
00:24:22.799 Ryan played it out basically let Samir
00:24:24.840 go first and then decided cars to go
00:24:26.820 second so basically he had like evenly
00:24:29.280 match which were not useful at all and
00:24:32.280 looking at Tom's sidekick indeed he has
00:24:34.559 a lot of cast for going yeah it's it's
00:24:36.539 very close because on the one hand as
00:24:38.520 you're saying his sideak is built
00:24:40.440 entirely pretty much for going second
00:24:42.299 but he's also meaning free crossout
00:24:44.400 which we have not seen yet and when you
00:24:46.679 play a Carla crossout you are guaranteed
00:24:48.900 to combo through much more easily going
00:24:50.940 first so I am really interested in
00:24:53.100 seeing well it's gonna go down but I've
00:24:54.960 heard a lot of cashier players say that
00:24:57.419 the either in the mirror match or
00:24:58.860 against malty's Pride they prefer to go
00:25:00.900 second so maybe though this game scared
00:25:03.840 the Tom we are gonna see some bias might
00:25:06.120 be in there on the other end though we
00:25:08.220 went through what Samir sides in going
00:25:10.200 first what do you think he's gonna bring
00:25:12.539 in go in second
00:25:14.280 Samir has a lot of good options in the
00:25:16.320 side deck here you know evenly matched
00:25:17.940 is pretty strong we might see those
00:25:19.799 Curry caras yeah you know we are seeing
00:25:21.780 a lot of things the other top four so
00:25:24.360 why not I think we will for sure sing
00:25:27.179 the kurikara
00:25:28.860 going inside samir's deck and I think
00:25:31.620 kurikara the internet made the
00:25:32.940 difference this weekend there were a lot
00:25:34.620 of things I think the curry Caro works
00:25:37.860 so particularly well against cached era
00:25:39.539 because a lot of monsters on the cashier
00:25:41.340 field trigger you know like the fenrir
00:25:42.900 the schangler and the standby face
00:25:43.919 there's a lot of things to Tribute but
00:25:45.659 when you're this deep into a tournament
00:25:47.159 and you're at this stage you probably
00:25:49.080 know at this point yeah
00:25:51.200 you do and uh at the same time some of
00:25:55.440 these cars are just there you cannot
00:25:58.559 really play around all of your opponent
00:26:00.600 options sometimes it's correct to just
00:26:03.419 call it a day and especially when we are
00:26:05.520 down to one final game it's probably at
00:26:09.720 least for Tom the most important game of
00:26:12.539 his career yet the maybe of his life and
00:26:15.360 for Samir as well I'm sure it's very
00:26:17.580 nerve-wracking it's very shaky huge
00:26:20.220 crowd but as mentioned we went through a
00:26:23.400 long journey and now there is one game
00:26:25.740 remaining five final cards to be drawn
00:26:28.860 from either of these to-do lists I think
00:26:32.039 it's about time let's jump into game
00:26:35.159 three the final game of ycs London
00:26:46.800 [Applause]
00:26:50.340 Samir versus Tom France versus Germany
00:26:54.840 Sprite versus kashtira the game three
00:26:59.340 final comes down to this as Tom gets to
00:27:04.440 begin and start this duel
00:27:08.100 what an incredible match this has been
00:27:10.200 absolutely so much back and forth this
00:27:12.779 is uh this is what you want to see from
00:27:14.340 a grand final don't you really really
00:27:16.679 hyped for this ending and I can tell you
00:27:19.140 already I saw the MVP of the top four in
00:27:23.400 akurikara in the end from Samir waiting
00:27:26.520 there okay so it's there
00:27:30.059 well if there's a start for Tom it's
00:27:33.179 gonna be special summoning unicorn isn't
00:27:34.980 it
00:27:36.440 might as well might as well
00:27:39.659 yeah the uh just a fun fact you know if
00:27:42.960 you actually look to the database and
00:27:44.520 type in unicorn about three quarters of
00:27:46.559 all those cards have been meta at some
00:27:47.940 point that's fair enough fair enough
00:27:52.020 all right well we're gonna go through
00:27:53.760 the uh the Motions here using the
00:27:55.799 apotheosis with the uh fan rear to be
00:27:58.140 able to search here how far do you go
00:28:00.480 how deep do you go do we have five lock
00:28:01.919 if we have it or do you plug more
00:28:03.900 conservatively I mean I say it's the
00:28:06.720 finals give us a show and just do it
00:28:09.779 just do it yeah just go all in but now
00:28:13.500 of course you wanna take it somewhat
00:28:15.360 conservatively but again at the same
00:28:17.159 time uh Samir has been on stream Samir
00:28:19.860 has been at the top table so you might
00:28:21.720 have know what he's playing what kind of
00:28:24.600 cars he has and uh maybe going all in is
00:28:27.539 the correct one
00:28:28.919 I also think you really want to see if
00:28:30.659 your opponent has any sort of
00:28:31.679 interruptions before you know going into
00:28:33.480 that approach but uh
00:28:35.279 no Ash blossoms or impermanences
00:28:37.200 anything like that I've been used so far
00:28:38.940 see Samir for now
00:28:41.279 pretty much ending back and yeah just
00:28:43.740 accepting his fate all right so I don't
00:28:46.860 think we're gonna see a five lock here
00:28:48.179 as we go for the Big Bang banish with
00:28:49.740 the rice heart yeah and it's so unevenly
00:28:51.539 matched banished by the book of eclipse
00:28:53.520 yeah yeah
00:28:57.240 Let's see we are still potentially gonna
00:29:00.539 see oh and he actually goes for the
00:29:02.580 monster which is an interesting one that
00:29:04.679 probably leads to not going for a five
00:29:07.919 lock usually what you would go for is we
00:29:10.140 have matching plenty of times the
00:29:12.120 spelling traps
00:29:14.220 so do you think there's a little bit of
00:29:16.260 a sort of strategy involved with which
00:29:18.600 exact Zone you look if you can only go
00:29:20.520 for two or three yeah sometimes it
00:29:22.620 depends on the on your opponent decks of
00:29:24.299 course especially when they're playing
00:29:25.380 Link monsters that's important for some
00:29:27.899 decks
00:29:29.100 in this specific matchup I don't think
00:29:32.100 it is that much but uh let's see let's
00:29:35.399 see because at the moment this this
00:29:36.960 opening is still very impressive from uh
00:29:40.140 Tom
00:29:41.399 all right so Diablo says the Mind hacker
00:29:44.399 gets to look through the extra deck of
00:29:46.620 Samir is the mosquito gone finally or is
00:29:49.919 he gonna make the same mistake as Ryan
00:29:51.840 leaving that mosquito there let's see
00:29:54.299 yeah so typically you want to hit those
00:29:56.520 powerful ghost seconds
00:30:00.000 I think someone watched the semi-final
00:30:02.880 yeah
00:30:03.899 yeah all right so uh the Zone will be
00:30:07.260 blocked off here from the first
00:30:09.120 banishing face down of the diablosis and
00:30:11.279 then Samir will be banishing cards on
00:30:12.960 top of the deck equals the number of
00:30:14.159 banished cards triggering the shangri-ra
00:30:15.840 once again to block off all of those
00:30:18.120 three zones underneath the extra monster
00:30:20.340 Zone
00:30:21.720 Samir did not check the last four cards
00:30:25.440 surprisingly
00:30:28.640 fair enough and now play is back to
00:30:32.820 Samir and I can tell you I also saw that
00:30:36.059 he drew into a triple tactics Talent
00:30:38.640 which is a great draw from the French
00:30:41.760 player talent and kurikara this could
00:30:44.159 actually be a good good way to break
00:30:46.200 this board because so question there's
00:30:48.840 been a bit of a debate over the course
00:30:50.340 of this entire format do you activate
00:30:52.440 Shangri in the standby phase a lot of
00:30:54.120 players have been opting to not use it
00:30:55.559 in the standby phase yeah I mean again
00:30:57.779 it really depends on what cards you
00:31:00.299 think your opponent is using because
00:31:02.760 with Talent that's fine it's the thrust
00:31:05.340 that it could be an issue but it's like
00:31:07.320 Curry car I'm kind of worried about here
00:31:08.760 I agree I agree with you and sometimes
00:31:11.460 it might be correct and that's exactly
00:31:13.140 what I think some years are starting
00:31:14.640 with so kurikara is the first card of
00:31:18.539 this game free for Samir getting rid of
00:31:21.120 the Shangri-La and developing uh three
00:31:24.419 thousand attack monster
00:31:27.840 it really does beg the question you know
00:31:30.360 was Tom aware that Samir was playing
00:31:33.179 this he's been on Samir has been on
00:31:34.860 feature he's probably had his friends
00:31:37.020 you know uh letting him know just
00:31:38.820 exactly what is being played and I think
00:31:41.039 that might be a little bit of a misstep
00:31:42.360 don't you agree yeah I know especially
00:31:43.679 because like as we were mentioning this
00:31:45.480 car has been played by most of our
00:31:47.279 players this weekend and uh I think as
00:31:50.100 you correctly mentioned these guys maybe
00:31:51.720 were close to each other but there's
00:31:53.640 another one I don't know what's been
00:31:55.080 hurt yeah wow there's another one
00:31:59.600 double Curry
00:32:01.870 [Applause]
00:32:05.480 incredible that's great unbelievable
00:32:08.460 Samir activating the talents in response
00:32:13.340 which he can use obviously
00:32:16.520 an opening by Samir you can see him
00:32:19.200 smiling you can probably hear some of
00:32:21.659 this crowd which is going crazy we're
00:32:24.059 shouting over you I can barely hear the
00:32:25.500 crowd are going crazy right now but
00:32:27.840 generator was special summoned by the
00:32:30.000 Shangri-La right this turn yes
00:32:37.440 yeah so this fan rear should be in
00:32:39.120 defense position yeah and uh I'm sure
00:32:41.279 our judges will correct that momentarily
00:32:44.220 but yeah this is a extremely powerful
00:32:46.919 setup here by Samir he is uh in a really
00:32:50.460 really good spot
00:32:52.260 that is a Sprite starter being activated
00:32:55.140 as well yeah what a hand from Samir now
00:32:57.779 they're gonna fix and put back the
00:32:59.580 failure to defense position correctly
00:33:01.620 but
00:33:03.240 it cannot be switched as it was summoned
00:33:05.760 this term but still making this uh what
00:33:09.240 an opening wow wow I mean
00:33:12.000 I mean you could that is incredible I I
00:33:14.640 actually didn't think the uh Corey Cara
00:33:16.740 was uh no one's return you know you
00:33:18.179 would assume something like that yeah
00:33:19.260 but while opening multiples of that
00:33:21.419 actually paying off here especially
00:33:23.279 because like heavy one already was
00:33:24.480 powerful
00:33:26.240 wow so what are the stats on it one is
00:33:28.860 15 one is 30. no they are both uh three
00:33:31.200 thousands yeah yeah okay so those are
00:33:35.159 your friends
00:33:37.200 that's unbelievable wow yeah
00:33:39.539 all right I mean diablosis not really
00:33:42.480 being able to interact or do much here
00:33:44.100 just by itself so uh a singular Set Card
00:33:46.700 uh from Tom
00:33:49.320 better be a good one yeah he definitely
00:33:52.200 needs it but wow
00:33:57.659 the rest of the end yeah it does have uh
00:34:00.419 he's wrong isn't it yeah oh no it's it's
00:34:03.360 the dream opening honestly I think this
00:34:05.519 is the kind of opening when you dream on
00:34:07.740 Saturday night of being in the finals
00:34:09.780 that will you imagine yourself drawing
00:34:12.418 and yeah sometimes dreams do come true
00:34:14.580 and yeah let's see if this will be the
00:34:17.339 case for some year can Samir pick up his
00:34:19.980 second victory
00:34:22.080 for a final of a major tournament
00:34:24.980 European Champion already
00:34:27.780 can he become a ycs champion and not
00:34:30.780 only a ycs champion
00:34:32.520 the champion of the largest ever
00:34:34.918 European ycs
00:34:36.839 that is an Accolade that people would
00:34:39.899 absolutely love to have in Samir is
00:34:42.300 Within Reach here as we have this double
00:34:44.699 3000 kurikara the Nimble hamsters uh
00:34:47.719 beavers being some special summoned from
00:34:50.219 the deck he would be Angler
00:34:52.260 Tom debating whether to actually use
00:34:55.020 something face down this must be the
00:34:57.420 moment let's see so we searched Sprite
00:35:00.540 carrot but we decided to special some in
00:35:02.460 the red instead yes which I agree with
00:35:04.020 you it's uh it's kind of debatable maybe
00:35:07.640 flashbacks of that Nibiru from game one
00:35:10.320 yeah well despite the fact that the
00:35:13.200 gigantic Sprite is now negated I don't
00:35:15.180 think he's super worried about that
00:35:17.160 right it was safer to go for the uh the
00:35:19.200 red lucky the mosquito he's gone so that
00:35:22.680 at least is not an issue but this is
00:35:24.540 still so much I think even if you just
00:35:27.839 is he playing the I mean
00:35:31.880 those lines uh he's not playing like
00:35:34.380 tomorrow no no no no but now on the
00:35:37.260 field how many last points because the
00:35:38.940 Diablos is
00:35:43.640 so yeah that's 32
00:35:50.099 all right well deciding let's go for
00:35:51.540 here he's considering the Buju monster
00:35:53.579 no we're gonna go for a second Sprinter
00:35:56.520 all right just gonna try and bounce back
00:35:59.160 the Diablo season that's all you need
00:36:00.839 honestly I also had the Nimble Beaver as
00:36:02.820 a normal sound yeah especially something
00:36:04.440 one from the deck and then he goes for
00:36:05.880 another gigantic and then this is enough
00:36:07.740 yes use its effect so this is plenty
00:36:11.099 plenty of possible look how fast he's
00:36:13.320 playing he knows it's within reach here
00:36:15.320 searching out the Sprite Smashers the
00:36:18.420 gigantic on 3200 30 30 on the curry cars
00:36:22.619 away from being the ycs champion you can
00:36:26.520 see Samir
00:36:28.079 thinking about it
00:36:30.960 responses here that is the Diablos is
00:36:33.359 being bad
00:36:34.870 [Applause]
00:36:36.960 victory
00:36:39.660 for some year wow
00:36:46.430 [Applause]
00:36:51.680 wow the crowd is going absolutely wild
00:36:55.339 is going crazy right now and you cannot
00:36:58.920 blame them what an ending and what a
00:37:01.260 match we just went through
00:37:04.800 wow honestly what a finals what a
00:37:08.880 weekend it has been and what a pleasure
00:37:11.280 to be with you guys doing this for all
00:37:14.640 of you at home watching uh we just
00:37:17.339 witnessed one of the best finals I've
00:37:19.560 seen in a long time yeah no we're just
00:37:22.079 waiting for our uh ceremony to take
00:37:24.119 place here so we can talk to you a
00:37:25.980 little bit about that incredible
00:37:27.420 incredible match
00:37:29.000 super emotional honestly because like
00:37:31.440 Samir lost game one exactly and uh it's
00:37:34.980 still calmed and uh he couldn't even be
00:37:38.040 here guys it's a crazy part of course
00:37:41.099 this is gonna be on again and again a
00:37:43.500 tale just to tell everyone but Samir in
00:37:47.160 an interview we had with him earlier on
00:37:49.280 mentioned that he wasn't supposed to be
00:37:51.540 here he didn't prepare with his friends
00:37:53.400 and he booked a flight eight hours prior
00:37:56.220 to the event just saying why not let's
00:37:59.160 go I'm confident I'm gonna try my best
00:38:01.200 with my deck with my very unique deck as
00:38:04.079 we mentioned it yeah a very unique
00:38:06.119 Sprite deck and he made it he made it
00:38:09.000 all the way becoming a two-time champion
00:38:11.160 European Champion now ycs Champion what
00:38:14.579 a journey it has been and going even
00:38:16.859 with a reverse sweep in the finals wow
00:38:19.920 yeah I mean the the the mind the
00:38:22.619 mentality to maintain your cool after
00:38:24.420 losing game one which
00:38:26.820 could maybe be argued that was winnable
00:38:28.740 at some point and then to take it yeah
00:38:30.980 yeah I mean
00:38:33.740 in game one and yeah that's that's
00:38:37.200 absolutely
00:38:38.820 phenomenal from him just again keeping
00:38:41.339 his composure and this is what really
00:38:43.920 stands out as the difference between you
00:38:46.500 know a very good player and a player
00:38:48.900 like Samir which we mentioned already in
00:38:51.900 the past was by far one of the best
00:38:54.119 players in Europe and as now I think
00:38:57.119 the serving Place among the legends of
00:39:00.119 the European Yu-Gi-Oh Community
