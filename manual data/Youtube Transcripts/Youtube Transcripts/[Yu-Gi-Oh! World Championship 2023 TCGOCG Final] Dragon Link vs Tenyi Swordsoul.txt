# https://www.youtube.com/watch/83uHLJbp1y8

00:00:00.560 Yu-Gi-Oh World Championship 2023 the
00:00:04.740 final is
00:00:10.620 three
00:00:12.000 two one
00:00:14.639 two
00:00:25.480 [Applause]
00:00:27.260 can't believe we are here finally at the
00:00:30.599 finals for the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG ocg World
00:00:33.480 Championship it's the USA against Peru
00:00:36.420 Latin America versus against North
00:00:38.219 America we've never had a winner from
00:00:40.559 the USA it's been a while since we've
00:00:42.899 had one from Latin America as well so
00:00:44.460 both these players really want to
00:00:45.660 represent their regions ah I just can't
00:00:48.300 wait to see how it's gonna work out it
00:00:49.680 does look like Paulie may be going first
00:00:51.420 here and you have come close a lot of
00:00:54.539 time and there are a lot of finalists
00:00:56.280 from the USA But as you mentioned not
00:00:59.340 quite but great star here from poly with
00:01:02.640 is dragonlings deck so starting with the
00:01:05.760 Bastille Loop Elliott if that's gonna
00:01:08.280 let him add any B steel from the deck to
00:01:10.200 the hand of course he's gonna go with
00:01:11.880 the one B steel Magnum
00:01:18.140 now you see that card on there that
00:01:20.520 means the deck has not been randomized
00:01:22.200 yet in this world championship we are
00:01:24.000 using a special shuffling procedure to
00:01:25.619 help dual save time they will not need
00:01:27.479 to randomize their decks until the point
00:01:29.040 at which they top a card of the deck
00:01:31.140 matters and needs to not be known so for
00:01:33.299 example the draw phase or playing a draw
00:01:35.640 type effect so while that card is on
00:01:37.740 there you're not going to be able to
00:01:38.579 draw anything from the deck or excavate
00:01:40.320 things to the top of the deck and when
00:01:42.060 it's time to go ahead and play one of
00:01:44.159 those effects of past turn then we'll
00:01:45.720 randomize the deck yep and we see a
00:01:47.579 quick launch coming down from poly so
00:01:49.020 here he's access to magnet and the
00:01:50.939 rocket engine he's able to quick launch
00:01:52.560 into that rocket Tracer link it away
00:01:54.420 immediately into the link one Striker
00:01:56.220 Dragon Striker dragon on summon one of
00:01:58.619 the best cards is pretty much wide
00:02:00.119 Dragon link exists it because it's
00:02:02.159 linking things together gonna able to
00:02:04.200 add that boot sector launch from the
00:02:05.520 deck to the hand
00:02:06.719 we have seen quick launch for dual links
00:02:09.660 today and now it's back in a different
00:02:12.319 finals in great decision I was a little
00:02:14.760 shocked when I saw it come down and in
00:02:17.220 our semi-final match even uh we got to
00:02:19.440 see three quick spots
00:02:24.480 I am pretty sure I also yeah so a great
00:02:27.720 opening app from Paulie here but we can
00:02:30.599 assume now that they know each other's
00:02:32.400 decks do you guys have any idea of why
00:02:35.160 you were gonna go for when you're facing
00:02:37.860 a deck like Warsaw on the other end I
00:02:40.379 mean this is tough I actually think this
00:02:41.580 matchup is kind of bad for Paulie
00:02:43.319 because one of the the notorious cards
00:02:45.300 that are really good against Dragon link
00:02:46.379 are those like Block cards like darker
00:02:48.180 Dark Ruler no more and we've seen that
00:02:50.340 Juan is actually main decking copies of
00:02:52.379 that so he might be prepared to go
00:02:53.940 second here and this is an interesting
00:02:55.080 opening he's going to link his wifer
00:02:57.360 burster into guard Dragon bitsy to go
00:02:59.220 into the extra monster Zone this seems
00:03:00.959 like one of the lines he was uh talking
00:03:02.640 about before so he kind of knows what
00:03:05.099 his opponent is up to here and he's
00:03:06.720 trying to you know Workshop ways to get
00:03:08.400 around it make sure that he has enough
00:03:10.019 ways to interrupt one on his turn even
00:03:12.060 if he has one of these pull out cards so
00:03:14.159 what you might do here is you have the
00:03:16.379 pistol there you're gonna get it off the
00:03:17.640 field here for Romulus and then if you
00:03:19.620 have a way to special summon it back
00:03:21.000 from the graveyard you can put it
00:03:22.080 wherever you want you're not beholden to
00:03:24.060 the link Eric then you might not have to
00:03:25.440 go into the triple burst line and can do
00:03:27.180 some other stuff as well instead that's
00:03:28.620 really cool and we see him add that
00:03:30.180 Dragon intervene off the Romulus
00:03:32.940 still has the Magna mode which is great
00:03:35.099 gonna come down to get something else in
00:03:36.959 the end phase and grab that lubelian to
00:03:39.780 set up some branded spelling traps so
00:03:42.720 great stuff here definitely now looks
00:03:45.599 like Paulie's taking a moment to
00:03:46.799 consider his options
00:03:49.319 activates the dragon Ravine he's gonna
00:03:51.599 be able to send a card from his hand to
00:03:52.860 the graveyard then send any dragon from
00:03:54.780 the deck to the graveyard
00:03:57.420 I'm gonna go ahead and yep he discards
00:04:00.180 the card and this
00:04:02.040 the ones ask him just for a little bit
00:04:04.680 of clarification there
00:04:07.560 and it looks like it's going to go
00:04:08.879 through
00:04:10.260 yep so outside of duel links we have
00:04:13.260 seen this deck win the master dual
00:04:16.680 Championship as well with Joshua
00:04:19.160 piloting it and so we might see another
00:04:21.839 world champion using the same deck in
00:04:23.940 three different categories that's uh
00:04:25.500 that's really unique I would say that
00:04:27.419 would be pretty crazy Dragon link one of
00:04:29.580 those strong decks I mean it's kind of a
00:04:31.500 rod name to give to a lot of decks of
00:04:33.360 course of course dragons links there's
00:04:35.040 just a lot of dragons but they
00:04:36.540 definitely all have those similar cards
00:04:38.280 like quick launch and the rocket
00:04:39.600 strategies as well despite being
00:04:41.100 colloquially known as Dragon Lake a lot
00:04:43.020 of its end board cards happen to be
00:04:44.580 Synchro monsters things like borrowload
00:04:46.620 Savage dragon or the best deal disc
00:04:48.060 spotter now very true it looks like he
00:04:50.280 does send apps a router to the graveyard
00:04:53.100 with the dragon ravine
00:04:55.080 and he looks like he or was that what he
00:04:57.120 discarded from his hand Maybe
00:04:59.120 most likely yeah I would assume so
00:05:01.680 that's great yeah so he's still thinking
00:05:03.720 on the dragon ravine
00:05:05.400 so no he soon to have the router with
00:05:06.840 the review not the card from the hand
00:05:08.340 and lets him add that rocket recharger
00:05:10.139 to the hand we weren't able to see the
00:05:11.880 discard since it was off camera and now
00:05:14.100 we are gonna change field spell into
00:05:16.199 that boot sector launch
00:05:18.500 which can special what you just searched
00:05:21.000 so that's probably where he's going for
00:05:22.979 in terms of you know what what kind of
00:05:25.259 field boot sector launches I guess it's
00:05:26.940 like a hangar Bay or something for
00:05:28.560 Dragon Monsters Just firing out of there
00:05:30.780 in the battle that's what I think so
00:05:32.460 you're loading up those dragon monsters
00:05:33.840 to be launched into the field and he
00:05:35.699 does have rocket Tracer and Rocket
00:05:37.320 recharge ER to come
00:05:42.780 and he's going to check the graveyard
00:05:44.220 here see what cards are all in there
00:05:47.360 was this car that I guess yeah from the
00:05:50.400 Ravine ah
00:05:52.919 we missed that that's an interesting
00:05:54.720 thing having drone launched yeah main
00:05:56.220 deck very good for this particular
00:05:57.840 tournament though given the Decks that
00:05:59.759 we're seeing Play other things like
00:06:01.380 Dragon link there are other combos like
00:06:02.699 rickerson Avalon as well yeah definitely
00:06:04.620 probably played a role in why he made it
00:06:06.419 here all the way to the finals of the
00:06:08.039 world championship
00:06:09.780 what do you think really is is job not
00:06:12.180 that great against Warsaw will you get
00:06:13.979 rid of the card or it's tough yeah you
00:06:16.500 have to catch them on like an emergence
00:06:17.880 or something but if they just have that
00:06:19.080 sort of Moya it's not going to do too
00:06:20.759 much damage there for you yeah yeah I
00:06:22.500 think it's one of the weaker
00:06:23.340 interruptions here so he's able to link
00:06:26.100 into the heratic seal because even
00:06:27.300 though normally when you see Tracer and
00:06:28.740 recharger you think the recharger was
00:06:30.360 someone from the Tracer but in this case
00:06:31.620 they both came from the hand so not
00:06:33.180 locked out of dark Monsters Just quite
00:06:34.740 yet
00:06:37.040 [Music]
00:06:41.400 has a seals in a tracer gonna activate
00:06:44.039 that Magnum there it is
00:06:47.639 which card is targeted
00:06:50.040 [Music]
00:06:53.460 there's a lot of cards we haven't seen
00:06:54.840 yet for example you know we haven't seen
00:06:56.880 the quick launch we haven't seen chaos
00:06:58.500 space things that you really want to be
00:07:00.360 seeing in your opening hand when you're
00:07:01.620 in the finals game going first
00:07:03.000 definitely Cass race is one of the best
00:07:04.919 cards in the dragon link deck
00:07:08.880 go ahead and banish
00:07:13.520 yep router seems so nope changed his
00:07:17.639 mind here
00:07:20.220 this is this is what we were worried
00:07:21.840 about maybe he's getting in his own head
00:07:23.099 and over yeah
00:07:25.380 goes with the apps router anyways gut
00:07:27.419 feeling
00:07:28.319 often right usually good to stick to at
00:07:30.660 worst case you at least can say you
00:07:31.800 relied on your gut if things go wrong as
00:07:33.780 opposed to the other way around but now
00:07:35.160 he is going to use that Tracer effect
00:07:36.419 quick effect destroying any card on your
00:07:38.460 field especially summon a rocket from
00:07:39.840 the deck
00:07:41.400 we'll see if he goes for that rocket
00:07:42.599 caliber
00:07:44.400 there it is
00:07:45.900 so now he's finally locked into this
00:07:48.660 darks could get back
00:07:51.300 I guess to set up I'm not sure which
00:07:53.940 branded spelling drops he's playing in
00:07:55.560 the deck but probably branded regained
00:07:57.660 the big one Beast sometimes is blade so
00:08:00.060 that could be another one true that's a
00:08:01.680 nice one especially here he has a level
00:08:04.440 six and a level four tuner he'll be able
00:08:06.300 to go into B steel dispatcher since they
00:08:07.979 are dragons
00:08:09.840 this is another thing that you know not
00:08:12.180 that I was eavesdropping but he was you
00:08:13.919 know quite loudly talking to himself the
00:08:15.660 entire time he was going over you know
00:08:17.520 the best choices to make specifically
00:08:19.080 with visceral disc powder because it
00:08:21.060 offers you that choice between
00:08:22.139 destroying something and negating the
00:08:23.759 activation of something
00:08:26.400 there it is
00:08:29.000 Federation does have a cool effect that
00:08:31.740 if your opponent activates the Carter
00:08:33.059 effect you can Shuffle back a bandage
00:08:34.440 card and then it has two different
00:08:35.399 effects if it was your card or your
00:08:37.020 opponents either destroys or banishes
00:08:39.419 based on who banished and you're right
00:08:40.740 here comes that Visa Rebellion
00:08:43.380 is going to Tribute the apps the router
00:08:45.660 that he brought back with the dispatcher
00:08:47.760 great star let's see which he got's got
00:08:50.820 to be branded Beach yeah it's like he's
00:08:52.200 going for the interruption maybe talking
00:08:53.760 about how he knew what his opponent's
00:08:55.080 playing wants that layered Interruption
00:08:56.519 knows that he's packing that dark world
00:08:57.959 no more on the main deck going for a
00:08:59.459 trap card heads up play here from Polly
00:09:01.740 and if you can find a way to get to
00:09:02.940 Sauron here and send Brandon regain to
00:09:05.040 the graveyard he'll be able to activate
00:09:06.240 it from the graveyard with that branded
00:09:07.740 Beast effect in the end phase I think he
00:09:09.660 might have entered no okay okay okay I
00:09:12.300 thought he was just gonna search for
00:09:13.680 that Magnum but
00:09:18.720 great stuff but as you mentioned dark
00:09:21.360 lure no more could be a card that's
00:09:23.399 really strong against this setup that's
00:09:25.380 part of why I think you want the Beast
00:09:26.760 here is you have that trap card based
00:09:28.440 interaction instead of a monster effect
00:09:29.880 absolutely really important to have
00:09:31.860 different kind of interactions
00:09:37.500 all right the judge also cutting the
00:09:39.360 deck there yep joining in on the action
00:09:42.060 yep that green oh it looks like a card
00:09:44.220 yeah yeah that was right we just didn't
00:09:47.100 catch for the search but I guess yeah
00:09:48.959 we'll find out
00:09:51.420 so I had to guess it'd be a beast deal
00:09:53.040 of sorts potentially there is a cute
00:09:55.200 interaction that you can do where if you
00:09:57.540 search you know one of the best deals
00:09:59.160 you can then pop it with the Tracer and
00:10:00.959 get even another Interruption true yeah
00:10:03.360 if if one puts a lighter dark in the
00:10:05.580 graveyard he can banish one's light or
00:10:07.260 dark from the graveyard or the V seal
00:10:08.580 and then that gives him a monster to put
00:10:09.779 back with the disc batter also and
00:10:11.940 tennis
00:10:16.200 evenly matched we were talking about Dr
00:10:18.839 Lenoir we haven't seen the evily Matched
00:10:20.760 yet in game one from one but this is
00:10:22.920 huge he has to pick I think you have to
00:10:25.080 go with the disc pattern here
00:10:30.260 okay so he does have a beastial in hand
00:10:32.820 he probably searches so he's going to
00:10:34.800 keep the Branded bees yeah I mean now
00:10:36.899 he's gonna get to summon off the erratic
00:10:39.180 seal so working scenario that works but
00:10:42.320 the heretic seals and he put one of his
00:10:44.820 own cards back in the hand I think the
00:10:47.399 police I might have seen a second copy
00:10:50.220 of the card in the end I'm not sure
00:10:51.720 though not sure that could be the case I
00:10:53.940 mean playing a car like evenly in the
00:10:55.680 main deck wow this might be the heads of
00:10:57.779 plate where he was hedging his bets
00:10:58.980 against dark lord and evenly knowing
00:11:00.600 that he could use the seals to return
00:11:02.040 his monster and get a monster on the
00:11:03.480 board afterwards I mean he could just go
00:11:04.680 for a beastial monster here if he
00:11:06.240 doesn't have one in hand as well just
00:11:09.420 take a look at ironic seal there note
00:11:10.860 that you do not have to choose one of
00:11:12.600 your opponent's cards to return to the
00:11:14.160 hand it's just that you have to use the
00:11:15.720 effect during your opponent's turn it
00:11:17.399 looks like he is going for bco not just
00:11:18.959 any BC is going to be ball drag you'll
00:11:20.579 ball Drake which can block the summon of
00:11:22.200 light and dark monsters
00:11:24.240 yep if he's able to get another Lighter
00:11:26.220 dark monster on the field that would be
00:11:27.720 quite useful
00:11:29.279 now those that uh beastial Baldrick is
00:11:31.800 going to be zeroed out with zero attack
00:11:33.120 zero defense because of the erratic
00:11:34.620 seals that doesn't matter too much right
00:11:36.540 now as the battle phase has now been
00:11:38.220 spent
00:11:46.860 is one of those decks where sometimes
00:11:49.560 you have a lot of plays but sometimes
00:11:51.120 you only have one one single Moyer and
00:11:53.880 if they interact with it that's it so
00:11:55.800 that brand of this could still get him
00:11:57.300 there yeah a lot and if they have the 10
00:11:59.100 new cars in their hand they really need
00:12:00.300 to keep another effect yeah evenly too
00:12:03.240 wow the end of the battle phase it's not
00:12:05.579 once per turn oh my gosh he says you
00:12:07.980 want to be solid fuel I'm gonna make
00:12:09.420 sure you don't keep it on the field I
00:12:11.459 said it's gonna be evenly matched not
00:12:13.440 you have two
00:12:15.060 Maybe
00:12:24.300 this is huge yeah huge star and now it's
00:12:27.480 so up to what is in one hand if he has
00:12:30.600 some of these swords or cards or not
00:12:35.160 he still has four cards to play with
00:12:36.959 this is your opportunity like you have
00:12:38.940 to really go off right now absolutely
00:12:45.839 so he's thinking about a normal summon
00:12:48.139 kubiatanya as well let's see maybe an
00:12:50.519 incredible Ecclesia you just gotta be
00:12:52.740 careful with the ashuna and bashuta
00:12:54.420 being light and dark uh oh okay it's a
00:12:57.600 good one if he discards a shootout that
00:13:01.680 would be crazy
00:13:04.440 let's see what he these cards
00:13:07.860 I see it oh you can't see what monster
00:13:10.139 it is let's see what he discards should
00:13:13.079 be
00:13:14.880 another one yeah
00:13:17.300 all right long One's Gonna Be summoned
00:13:20.040 and then we're gonna get the sword Soul
00:13:21.540 token
00:13:24.480 this can open up some place
00:13:30.010 [Music]
00:13:33.779 and we also need to find out what car
00:13:36.060 was added off the Magna mode because if
00:13:37.920 it was a pistil we could still steal
00:13:40.019 that now alongside the Branded Beast so
00:13:42.540 that's still an option for poly
00:13:44.399 potentially yeah
00:13:49.620 see which beastial it is yeah now now
00:13:52.200 there's a monster on the field so all
00:13:53.760 the beastials effects turn to Quick
00:13:55.200 effects it seems like he's considering
00:13:57.060 it and he could get rid of both cars
00:13:59.160 right now is probably the one he added
00:14:02.519 off that Magnum but it makes sense yeah
00:14:05.760 so that could still be nice
00:14:07.720 [Music]
00:14:09.420 probably down but not out
00:14:13.740 yes
00:14:15.000 it is the Druid form now he's gonna use
00:14:17.519 branded beast that's gonna tribute to
00:14:19.320 Drew a swarm and then it's gonna be able
00:14:21.720 to destroy a card on the field and the
00:14:23.220 Jerusalem will be able to send a special
00:14:24.360 summon monster so it's going to clear
00:14:25.560 both
00:14:27.720 and now Juan has something like sorts of
00:14:29.459 Italia it could be yeah pretty good time
00:14:32.399 uh for like some way to get around this
00:14:34.440 like a kind of Dragon Circle help you
00:14:36.240 here you tribute any worm right or
00:14:37.740 anything yep any worm
00:14:40.620 Heavenly Dragon Circle would be a good
00:14:42.540 card
00:14:45.800 even if you follow it up with just like
00:14:48.120 a normal summer
00:14:49.800 I mean a lot yeah just to allow them to
00:14:52.260 search for that sorts of little tie if
00:14:53.519 he does have it yeah
00:14:56.279 such a good card there it is Heavenly
00:14:59.399 Dragon Circle
00:15:01.440 lets you attribute that worm to add any
00:15:03.600 worm from your deck to your hand all
00:15:06.000 right now we're gonna get the chain
00:15:07.320 resolving here
00:15:09.720 yeah that's
00:15:11.279 that's great honestly you look at those
00:15:13.440 four cars two copies of each but then
00:15:15.300 you really need something to play with
00:15:16.740 and
00:15:19.320 it'll be really impressive if he can get
00:15:21.060 through all this like Polly played this
00:15:22.440 turn incredibly well
00:15:24.300 like you knew what to do with the cards
00:15:25.920 that he was dealt here but will it
00:15:27.839 matter
00:15:31.199 I mean uh he still hasn't normal as you
00:15:33.540 mentioned so he could go for even the
00:15:35.339 moyer if he has a you know another
00:15:36.899 another monster in the end I know
00:15:39.300 there's war so far let's see
00:15:45.600 I mean at the very worst he's gonna be
00:15:47.279 able to get Taya to go into chichow to
00:15:49.019 grab blackout at very minimum but if he
00:15:50.760 does have a worm he could do much more
00:15:53.339 yeah so we'll get a draw at least Amelia
00:15:57.260 and yeah and the hilly Dragon Circle
00:15:59.699 also provides you with follow-up uh you
00:16:02.100 can't use it that's great right effect
00:16:03.060 to turn it sent there but if it's been
00:16:04.860 there for a turn if you've got to
00:16:06.300 control a non-effect monster you're able
00:16:07.380 to banish it from the graveyard and add
00:16:08.579 a tiny from your deck to your hand
00:16:10.860 it'd be interesting if this gets down to
00:16:12.540 a top deck war between them which player
00:16:14.339 has the edge sword soul for sure to me I
00:16:17.459 mean there are a few top decks over
00:16:19.380 there you know I mean cars like labion
00:16:21.480 here could be really nice so I think
00:16:23.820 it's close yeah
00:16:25.500 all right he's gonna grab the um oh yeah
00:16:28.199 okay
00:16:29.820 it's not what Paulie wants to see now
00:16:31.620 he's gonna use the Drew storm effect to
00:16:33.180 send that token away so we're
00:16:35.100 telegraphing that that last card is in
00:16:37.019 fact a worm monster yes for sure it
00:16:39.660 would be a car that allows you to use
00:16:41.220 them oh yeah
00:16:44.040 but there are still a lot of cars I
00:16:45.899 think oh two cars in the end from poly
00:16:48.600 and I know one's the beastial Rebellion
00:16:50.339 that he returned I did pick that the
00:16:52.800 other one not gonna spoil her but it's
00:16:55.139 gonna be a relevant one
00:16:56.880 later on let's see
00:17:00.240 we can assume the Moya is next I guess
00:17:04.020 takes a quick look at the graveyard here
00:17:06.480 checking to see what the follow-up is
00:17:08.339 what Paul is going to be able to do on
00:17:09.900 the next turn
00:17:12.540 I'm surprised he didn't go for Taya here
00:17:14.640 because with Taya if you have the other
00:17:16.559 worm in your hand you can go into the
00:17:18.000 box you get rid of the Branded bees
00:17:19.559 there it is
00:17:21.650 [Music]
00:17:24.260 huge all the answers coming from Paulie
00:17:27.119 huge
00:17:29.040 well what I was going to say is Taya can
00:17:30.780 also get you to Moye and remove the
00:17:32.280 brand of Beast along the along the way
00:17:33.120 but
00:17:35.220 as well wow
00:17:39.550 [Music]
00:17:42.179 one sword Soul monster yeah now we're in
00:17:44.580 trouble but here's nothing he just has a
00:17:47.460 Moye
00:17:48.480 all right so Paulie has we know he's got
00:17:51.179 the bestial Rebellion he is in the
00:17:53.100 driver's seat with the buranda beast on
00:17:54.840 the field that affect me that was huge
00:17:56.700 the biggest effect failure of Paulie's
00:17:58.919 life Wow
00:18:01.940 through the graveyard here first off
00:18:06.720 wow I was riding Polly off for this one
00:18:08.940 I can't believe that last card we didn't
00:18:10.080 know wasn't effect Valor yeah
00:18:13.100 and now yeah there is the lubelian and
00:18:15.900 one clutch top deck here but
00:18:19.200 as you mentioned we shouldn't forget
00:18:20.760 that the circle is still there for next
00:18:22.620 turn very true and with the ashuna in
00:18:25.080 hand that's a good way to get a normal
00:18:26.400 monster onto the board absolutely it's
00:18:29.039 probably can find a way to keep B seals
00:18:30.960 to keep it out of the graveyard it's
00:18:32.760 gonna be tough
00:18:34.860 now notably in this particular
00:18:36.539 tournament oh
00:18:39.360 so he doesn't even need the Pieces Just
00:18:41.760 Gonna use the chaos space because he'll
00:18:42.960 be able to bring back the piece of the
00:18:44.280 belly on by trimming a dragon
00:18:45.559 unbelievable there is the lavender and
00:18:48.120 with the wiper Buster and collapse
00:18:49.740 serpent used at the beginning he can
00:18:51.539 just get a draw off here with the cow
00:18:53.760 space or the link and we talked about
00:18:56.160 how strong a car that is in the driving
00:18:57.480 strategy and he didn't open it but able
00:18:59.580 to top deck it here in the second turn
00:19:01.500 is huge
00:19:04.440 would you go for darks here or what
00:19:07.260 what's your idea here if you know that
00:19:09.360 I'm ripping the card out of yeah if it's
00:19:11.640 possible you got to put them on zero
00:19:13.140 cards I agree especially when it's
00:19:14.580 something like ashuna which has a lot of
00:19:16.080 Versatility in it as well so one dark
00:19:19.020 would you not lie I guess yeah the line
00:19:21.660 would be do you want to see this group
00:19:23.700 yeah I guess so three dark monsters
00:19:27.140 chaos Dragon living in here gonna send
00:19:29.700 that card in the hand back into the dick
00:19:31.380 my only concern was maybe using the
00:19:34.200 space first to see what you get into it
00:19:36.720 right yeah maybe I agree with yeah that
00:19:38.880 might be the case and I agree with but I
00:19:40.440 guess he doesn't want to risk drawing
00:19:41.940 maybe the last branded spell that's
00:19:43.440 that's what it is about yeah so you'll
00:19:45.960 attribute that chaos Dragon living here
00:19:47.880 to summon lubellion Rebellion can
00:19:49.620 activate its effects who place that
00:19:50.820 branded regain straight from the deck
00:19:52.620 onto the field so now he has branded
00:19:54.660 Beast branded regained with the BC on
00:19:56.580 the field Juan with zero cards after
00:19:58.620 this movie is gonna be destroyed by
00:19:59.880 battle and that kind of takes the Dragon
00:20:02.160 Circle out as well you're not gonna be
00:20:03.780 able to get a normal monster here
00:20:04.860 nothing this is looking so good for
00:20:07.500 Polly unless he wants to concede I would
00:20:10.080 no I would never do that I mean there is
00:20:12.419 no time limit sure mentioned it so no no
00:20:14.580 reason to do that and there are still
00:20:16.559 cars you know like part of this Iris if
00:20:18.419 he's playing it maybe something like
00:20:19.919 that would be nice you know I just get
00:20:21.960 like another board wipe something that
00:20:23.760 can just destroy your baby
00:20:34.200 like that who knows another evenly I
00:20:36.299 guess there's as long as you have a life
00:20:37.679 point there is a chance oh absolutely so
00:20:40.140 here comes that chaos space now that the
00:20:41.760 brand regain is out of the deck ready to
00:20:44.100 regain also poses a threat as well able
00:20:46.500 to special someone back a b seal when
00:20:48.299 your opponent summons a monster
00:20:50.039 so he'll be able to bring back something
00:20:51.179 like drew a storm contributed off with
00:20:52.620 Brandon Beast as well I'm gonna put back
00:20:54.780 that one copy of Striker dragon
00:20:57.000 draws one makes sense
00:20:59.580 doesn't really need to draw into
00:21:01.559 anything at the moment
00:21:05.220 let's see
00:21:06.660 as normal salmon yet so
00:21:13.940 what little dragon oh wow here's the
00:21:17.460 concession he knows it's over he knows
00:21:19.500 this means he's gonna look away the
00:21:20.700 striker Dragon red eyes darkness metal
00:21:22.679 dragon would come next and Juan's ready
00:21:24.539 to go on to the next game and Polly is
00:21:27.240 one game away and away from being the
00:21:29.940 first ever world champion for the United
00:21:31.860 States
00:21:37.940 thank you
00:21:40.080 all right all right here we go we're
00:21:41.580 getting the final cut from our judges
00:21:43.370 [Music]
00:21:44.760 could be the last game of the entire
00:21:47.520 world championship we've already crowned
00:21:49.200 duel links world champion the national
00:21:50.820 team world champions this is our final
00:21:53.400 match will one put you two in game three
00:21:56.520 you decided we have four world champions
00:21:59.400 crowned already one more and let's see
00:22:02.640 this
00:22:04.320 Juan's chosen to go first absolutely
00:22:08.540 [Music]
00:22:10.200 obviously wants to get into those words
00:22:12.960 go combos
00:22:15.480 let's see
00:22:16.860 starts with Auditors all right so Papa
00:22:19.500 desires is in there
00:22:21.419 always nice get that plus one right away
00:22:24.419 oh and the ash Blossom that's huge
00:22:29.580 that one only playing with four card
00:22:31.080 still a great deck but it needs
00:22:33.090 [Music]
00:22:34.380 that's a big deal
00:22:36.419 we said it it's worth so very strong but
00:22:39.000 sometimes it just whiffs on those plays
00:22:41.460 let's see if he has anything to follow
00:22:43.380 this up
00:22:53.900 no effect monsters controls No Monsters
00:22:56.640 so that works but it's a line monster so
00:22:59.059 beastials could be in there for Paulie
00:23:01.620 but that's not the case not not yet
00:23:03.360 anyway he also has the vashutis who's
00:23:05.220 able to link in the book of the Chinese
00:23:06.299 festival now ashuna is going to specimen
00:23:08.460 at Hara that gives him a level seven
00:23:10.260 monster a level one tuner that means you
00:23:12.360 can go into a level 8 Synchro like Chi
00:23:14.159 Chow I like to do this play when I
00:23:15.600 already have mojic so I can also go into
00:23:16.860 like a ciao Fang or something but when
00:23:18.720 you don't have the social engine still
00:23:20.340 good to rely on this way to go into a
00:23:21.900 sword soul chichao but I think he's
00:23:24.059 really happy about the business because
00:23:25.679 if he doesn't have any other words for
00:23:27.419 cars in end that be still could have
00:23:29.520 pretty much cut him off comboing it
00:23:31.500 would have been devastating yeah
00:23:33.240 but having two tinnies like this is
00:23:35.159 ideal for sword souls are definitely a
00:23:37.679 strong start for Juan
00:23:40.559 looks like he's considering boxia
00:23:45.840 he's probably just yeah okay no way I
00:23:48.240 would say yeah I don't think so not with
00:23:49.740 nothing like he could go into boxing for
00:23:52.320 a Chao Fang play because you can boxing
00:23:53.640 destroy the monk to bring back ahara but
00:23:55.200 if you don't have the sword Soul access
00:23:56.520 you usually want to go to chichao
00:23:58.820 Baylor the MVP of the deck now he's
00:24:02.280 gonna be able to banish that heart since
00:24:03.299 he has no
00:24:05.400 worm from the
00:24:06.780 from the to the hand adds back a shoe of
00:24:08.820 it will effect either be the card for
00:24:11.220 Paulie to win the World Championship
00:24:12.900 this weekend it's one in game one maybe
00:24:15.840 it could win in game two as well but
00:24:18.780 we'll have to see there's still plenty
00:24:20.220 of cards left for one to play yes two
00:24:22.320 points of interaction from Polly when
00:24:24.120 he's went second
00:24:29.120 if he has something else here otherwise
00:24:34.980 might just set some face Downs he still
00:24:37.679 has the chi Chow on the floor nothing to
00:24:40.620 set that's it he passed wow
00:24:43.620 all right so Dragon link playing on
00:24:45.659 three cards drawing to four
00:24:49.280 spinning Ash Blossom spent an effect
00:24:51.780 failure
00:24:53.640 I mean I would be shocked if he was not
00:24:55.860 holding maybe his own copies you know of
00:24:57.960 a maxi or anything like that but hey
00:25:00.659 Maxi sorry Ash Blossom I wish I was
00:25:02.880 still I'm still back yeah yeah
00:25:06.679 get out of 2017. you know that wasn't
00:25:10.559 there even even so startly safer
00:25:15.000 excellent normal someone from falling
00:25:18.059 not a bad one to have here gives you
00:25:20.280 access to those baby Chaos Dragons and
00:25:23.280 there's no sort Soul card available for
00:25:25.260 teach out of banish is there good
00:25:27.000 banners from the hand but it's gonna be
00:25:29.279 tough
00:25:33.179 yeah
00:25:35.820 he's like that will go through
00:25:40.080 it's gonna go battle first nice so that
00:25:43.140 makes sense go to battle take out the
00:25:44.760 non-effect monster first just in case
00:25:47.220 something goes wrong in your turn I like
00:25:49.200 the heads up play here yeah playing it
00:25:51.659 on ash Blossom I guess very smart so
00:25:54.299 yeah Striker Dragon not quite strong
00:25:55.860 enough
00:25:57.539 I'm
00:25:58.980 um
00:26:00.200 all right well played by poly yeah
00:26:11.240 Ash wants to enjoy spring if you
00:26:14.159 activate an effect that includes any of
00:26:16.080 these add a card from deck to the hand
00:26:18.120 which is what safer does special
00:26:19.919 something from the deck or send cards
00:26:22.140 from the deck to the graveyard you can
00:26:24.000 use ash Blossom enjoy spring indicate
00:26:25.679 that that is from Ali
00:26:28.440 oh my gosh these Ash blossoms and effect
00:26:30.840 failures really stopping them in there
00:26:36.659 too
00:26:40.860 yeah yeah it's like yeah I I've seen
00:26:44.520 this before
00:26:46.220 so the emergence does give him that
00:26:48.419 sword Soul card in the graveyard so he
00:26:50.039 still has that chichao effect now to
00:26:51.779 negate a monster effect but just in
00:26:53.400 getting a monster effect not the
00:26:54.840 strongest against dragonlings level a
00:26:56.400 lot of ways to force that out and
00:26:58.020 continue their plays so it seems like
00:26:59.580 what's happened here is that Polly's got
00:27:01.020 all his side deck cards and all of his
00:27:02.760 you know main decked interaction and you
00:27:05.520 know not the cards he needs to actually
00:27:06.720 play his strategy he's gonna need
00:27:09.120 something like a quick launch
00:27:11.600 that's that safer it would have gotten
00:27:13.919 there but it did not make it
00:27:15.779 yeah let's see even the red eyes engine
00:27:18.360 would be nice to draw into right now but
00:27:23.279 I wonder if knowing oh I'm not even
00:27:25.500 gonna say it I can't okay I'm saying I
00:27:27.779 wonder if no one is playing it's
00:27:29.640 backfired on him he passes back
00:27:32.100 passes back
00:27:34.980 you know I just got one more turn out of
00:27:37.260 this Oh cannot finish it off yes keep on
00:27:40.380 whiffing looks like you're right about
00:27:41.700 that top digest you just don't draw any
00:27:44.400 of the cards yeah come a lot of the
00:27:45.779 cards require other cards to be useful
00:27:47.659 Paulie's got to do it this time though
00:27:49.860 he's only gonna have 2400 left possibly
00:27:53.039 only one more drill for Paulie to stay
00:27:55.500 in this game or we might go into game
00:27:57.299 three soon
00:28:00.720 I kind of want to see a game three
00:28:03.779 yes for sure
00:28:06.320 2400 left
00:28:08.220 I mean that's a long one and a Sinister
00:28:10.080 long one let's see yeah it's or just one
00:28:13.020 finish long one resolving both you know
00:28:15.500 but you're probably going to use a
00:28:17.340 longer one on your way to make it very
00:28:18.779 true oh but Juan's got a face down
00:28:20.779 picked up could be something useful one
00:28:24.179 more drill for Paulie
00:28:37.820 he's held that Cosmic cycle in his hand
00:28:40.140 this whole game this is his one
00:28:41.640 opportunity to win this game
00:28:43.799 is it gonna be enough or is it too
00:28:45.900 little too late it's Paulie gonna
00:28:47.700 complete the perfect season that's what
00:28:49.440 I didn't want to say I didn't want to
00:28:50.700 say maybe he cited in the cosmic cycle
00:28:52.140 because he knew he was playing anti-self
00:28:53.220 fragrance and would have backfired on
00:28:54.419 him but he ended up drawing into the
00:28:55.799 anti-spell fragrance and it didn't
00:28:57.059 backfire
00:28:58.460 does he have any sort of play here to
00:29:01.200 push past
00:29:02.120 I mean
00:29:03.840 having chained that Cosmic I would
00:29:05.700 assume so okay that's good enough to at
00:29:09.539 least deal with the chi Chow
00:29:11.940 yeah I guess that's decent enough to
00:29:15.240 stay in
00:29:16.860 gets rid of the shoot as well
00:29:19.380 all right so this fuel drew his farm is
00:29:21.600 on the field when that sent to the
00:29:23.039 graveyard a special summon monster is
00:29:24.720 gonna go with it
00:29:26.600 does he have another Monster to summon
00:29:31.620 the kingdom for a link monster in Dragon
00:29:33.539 link yeah
00:29:37.740 let's see taking his time to think about
00:29:40.380 this one
00:29:42.000 but looking at this extra deck so we can
00:29:43.919 assume he has at least anything to
00:29:45.840 normal some or maybe it's something
00:29:47.100 along that I know
00:29:49.320 he's thinking about it could be anything
00:29:51.299 if it's black metal dragon I think he'd
00:29:53.100 just be slam it on the table but it
00:29:54.419 might be an awkward thing like rocket
00:29:55.860 recharge might be another beastial
00:29:57.179 because he's looking at the graveyard
00:29:58.500 right now I think he might be right yeah
00:30:00.779 it is oh but that's a good one
00:30:03.659 near able to access that Rebellion later
00:30:06.480 on Cerner notably the one pistol you can
00:30:08.760 play at three in this tournament every
00:30:10.620 other one is limited pretty good still
00:30:12.179 in Dragon League being able to send down
00:30:13.440 Brandon regain to bring back with
00:30:14.700 Brandon Beast
00:30:21.899 he has two V seals on the field two
00:30:24.179 dragons on the field the Druid storm
00:30:26.399 will deal with the chi Chow he's going
00:30:28.080 to take them away
00:30:30.480 obviously the way that this can work
00:30:33.240 okay it makes sense yep that makes sense
00:30:36.720 summon number three here from Holly
00:30:40.140 Gonna Stand away
00:30:43.980 I mean checking the graveyard here let's
00:30:47.340 see if he wants to change she shall
00:30:53.960 does not negate it permanently so it
00:30:56.700 makes sense that it just allows that
00:30:58.679 let's go into the end of the turn
00:31:01.500 foreign
00:31:08.240 er's gonna send down the beach silver
00:31:10.260 Rebellion that's the best combo
00:31:13.500 now we're gonna banish the safer to pick
00:31:15.960 up yeah
00:31:18.480 nice play here from poly
00:31:26.600 now he discards that Beast a little
00:31:28.980 belly on
00:31:31.860 oh he's gonna be careful here
00:31:35.399 because when your opponent is drawing
00:31:36.659 cards and passing right you got to think
00:31:38.399 about what are those cards that are in
00:31:39.539 here and they could potentially be
00:31:40.620 they're either going to be just
00:31:41.640 something they can't use or something
00:31:43.080 that's going to interact with you on
00:31:44.220 your turn things like the evil mash for
00:31:46.500 instance that you've already seen true
00:31:47.940 he knows one of them so at least that's
00:31:50.880 what he has to think about but
00:31:53.460 yeah
00:31:54.559 foreign
00:31:57.740 number four here from Paulie and now the
00:32:01.080 Magma's gonna activate as well get a
00:32:03.179 dragon in the end phase
00:32:05.059 what's up
00:32:06.899 go to battle
00:32:08.580 Magnemite hits
00:32:11.000 and we'll see if there is in fact an
00:32:13.980 even a match
00:32:16.620 know if you did get hit by evenly here I
00:32:18.360 wonder which one you keep yeah at the
00:32:20.640 same time I mean going first tough that
00:32:23.460 he would keep in you know they evenly
00:32:25.200 matched maybe true I think you just do
00:32:26.880 the seals trick and bounce the seal
00:32:28.500 trivia seals bounce but that leaves you
00:32:31.140 completely open right yeah but I would
00:32:33.059 be surprised if if you've kept those in
00:32:35.100 I guess
00:32:38.880 1400 life points left
00:32:42.240 it feels like the tides have turned on
00:32:44.340 this one that probably started to take
00:32:45.899 commands yeah but with only 1400 left
00:32:48.899 you could still just you know Juan's got
00:32:52.020 a punch dance here this Rebellion is
00:32:54.179 summoned number five for Paulie
00:32:59.240 now one is saying on the summon I'm
00:33:01.740 going to take a moment to think here
00:33:02.760 before you activate or before you place
00:33:04.559 that branded sweller trap from your deck
00:33:06.240 to the field so Juan has something
00:33:11.279 if you've got it I think this is the one
00:33:13.019 chance because once those branded spells
00:33:14.820 get on the field or the regained in
00:33:16.860 particular gets on the field yeah that's
00:33:18.779 when it starts to get out of control at
00:33:21.059 the same time yeah not an easy decision
00:33:23.700 here from Juan
00:33:25.740 hmm
00:33:27.380 oh gosh
00:33:29.580 a lot of BCS ran through out of Polly's
00:33:31.860 deck already Magnum can add back from
00:33:34.019 the graveyard though yeah damn deck or
00:33:36.419 graveyard
00:33:37.550 [Music]
00:33:39.140 there is there there any beer and a beer
00:33:42.419 the Primal being on the fifth summon the
00:33:45.059 Rock's gonna come down unfortunately
00:33:47.039 seals is contributed you know no matter
00:33:49.559 how it's tributed will it get its effect
00:33:51.240 to summon a dragon from the deck
00:33:55.200 and that's huge actually that's why one
00:33:57.120 was thinking about it because this does
00:33:59.399 stop the Rebellion from getting a
00:34:01.860 Brandon spelling traps but it might even
00:34:04.019 lead to a better combo at the end you
00:34:06.179 know hey in return Paula gets any dragon
00:34:08.820 out of his death yeah
00:34:10.440 into a law here
00:34:12.000 even something as innocuous as black
00:34:14.099 metal dragon for instance could turn
00:34:15.780 into you know a complete combo Tracer
00:34:18.060 into a borload Savage would be solid
00:34:19.980 because he just passed the first turn so
00:34:21.719 he hasn't accessed you know his boot sex
00:34:24.179 to the launch Dragon Ravine everything
00:34:25.859 is still in the dark so
00:34:30.139 oh my Lord
00:34:36.080 making sure he doesn't make a mistake at
00:34:39.000 this stage in the game this is the most
00:34:41.760 important game of his dueling careers it
00:34:44.159 is and now he knows everything he knows
00:34:46.139 the last card in and from his opponent
00:34:48.060 as he took that back from the banished
00:34:51.000 and now all he needs to do is just think
00:34:53.520 about what possible out could he pick up
00:34:55.560 from the top of the deck and otherwise
00:34:57.240 he is good to go there's a Starly safer
00:35:01.760 effect to send itself to the graveyard
00:35:06.660 checking to see if you can use both
00:35:07.980 effects in the same turn indeed you can
00:35:09.780 yes
00:35:12.480 so he's gonna get a level four dragon
00:35:15.300 level four dragon
00:35:19.859 and there it is wiper blaster
00:35:23.380 [Music]
00:35:25.760 whatever Buster banishing the beastial
00:35:28.260 sore near the touchdown onto the field
00:35:29.820 but only for a moment where it's uses a
00:35:32.220 link summon for a link one and that's
00:35:33.720 right it's Striker Dragon chain link one
00:35:36.599 stronger dragon tanely two Ivor burster
00:35:41.400 and here is where that Cosmic cycling on
00:35:44.099 the Untouchable fragrance goes into
00:35:45.900 fruition because he can activate that
00:35:47.880 boot sector launch I was debating for a
00:35:49.980 moment whether it was worth using the
00:35:51.960 cosmic because you could just keep that
00:35:54.000 anti-spell to you know make your
00:35:55.619 opponent draw into those spells and
00:35:57.119 maybe that could be more usable to you
00:35:59.460 but I guess we'll see
00:36:01.560 if it could be your last turn you got to
00:36:03.480 play it if you got it right yep
00:36:06.900 gonna summon the clapser from banishing
00:36:08.760 the wyvern burster
00:36:12.180 my heart is beating so hard right now
00:36:14.940 because I can tell what is about to
00:36:17.339 happen
00:36:19.560 history is we're moments away from
00:36:22.140 history we made our Trading Card Game
00:36:28.560 link two Dragon Knight Romulus we're
00:36:30.780 gonna see the dragon link combo coming
00:36:32.520 down here turns into this game Paulie
00:36:34.920 low on life points but as long as you
00:36:36.240 have a life point you have a chance
00:36:37.740 that's the best part about the Yu-Gi-Oh
00:36:39.960 Trading Card Game
00:36:42.060 believing in yourself believing in the
00:36:44.160 heart of the cards
00:36:49.740 just really intense thinking here for
00:36:52.380 probably this this is a combo that I've
00:36:54.000 already done a billion times
00:36:56.099 but you still have to make sure that you
00:36:58.200 do it right
00:36:59.520 only pictures of the Bureau of his own
00:37:01.260 for the dragon ravine
00:37:03.780 allowing him to send a dragon from the
00:37:05.640 deck to the graveyard let's see what he
00:37:07.440 goes with maybe an apps a router
00:37:09.839 there it is apps around it makes sense
00:37:11.820 rocket
00:37:13.380 and now we know every single car from
00:37:15.119 poly as well so he just has that boot
00:37:17.579 sector two special summoned that from
00:37:19.859 the end later on
00:37:22.010 [Music]
00:37:26.700 yeah Easter is in the making we said it
00:37:28.920 first time ever we already have four
00:37:30.780 world champions uh in our ends and we
00:37:33.780 could get the fifth in just minutes away
00:37:35.940 from here
00:37:37.500 uses that boot sector launch gonna
00:37:39.060 special someone to the rocket Tracer
00:37:40.619 from the hand
00:37:45.540 checks over the graveyard there
00:37:50.480 we see him eyeing quad borrowed Dragon
00:37:53.579 to maybe bring back
00:37:55.320 some of the Rockets from the graveyard
00:37:56.880 Club world is a great way to turn
00:37:58.380 dragons that aren't Rockets into rockets
00:38:00.480 that you need
00:38:03.990 [Music]
00:38:05.839 so first we're going to use the rocket
00:38:08.099 Tracer effect here does he destroy the
00:38:10.320 Nibiru token or the boot sector launch
00:38:13.200 trying to figure it out right about now
00:38:17.400 yeah he's making sure he doesn't make a
00:38:18.960 mistake at this stage in the game that
00:38:20.400 he goes through each motion correctly
00:38:21.960 and he does go for that boot sector
00:38:24.420 launch makes sense now reminder for
00:38:27.839 everybody at home this round is untimed
00:38:31.079 we do need to play at a reasonable Pace
00:38:33.119 however
00:38:37.020 Here Comes rocket recharger
00:38:42.480 now we'll see if we're gonna go into a
00:38:44.640 link summon we could go into the Beastie
00:38:46.980 first though
00:38:48.119 that's also an option to get something
00:38:50.040 back later on
00:38:52.320 indeed
00:38:53.900 our Dragon pisty link three rockets
00:38:57.900 triple burst dragon
00:39:00.420 now you see the right arrow and the down
00:39:02.160 arrow both pointing to the same zones
00:39:04.020 that means that guard Dragon Pistons
00:39:05.579 effect is live
00:39:10.339 confess someone from the banished or the
00:39:12.839 graveyard non-targeting
00:39:18.920 about getting the striker Dragon
00:39:21.180 regardless I don't think it's gonna stay
00:39:23.160 there long
00:39:24.960 so he's gonna use Striker dragon's
00:39:26.339 effect to destroy the token to add back
00:39:28.020 I'd imagine rocket recharging
00:39:30.599 it is indeed rocket recharger
00:39:33.660 and then because the monster was
00:39:35.160 destroyed rocket recharger activates
00:39:39.480 now we've got triple bursts Misty
00:39:42.839 Striker Dragon triple burst Dragon
00:39:44.839 versus niviru
00:39:47.760 none of these are big enough on their
00:39:49.440 own however
00:39:51.000 but he'll be the Boral end will be able
00:39:53.280 to negate the rocket recharger effect to
00:39:55.020 bring back the Tracer so he's going to
00:39:56.640 be able to have borrow end and borrow
00:39:58.140 load Savage dragon ball and dragon hits
00:40:01.320 the field with 3500 attack points its
00:40:05.339 effect negates rocket rechargers special
00:40:07.200 someone's back rocket Tracer that's a
00:40:09.180 level four tuner level four non-tuner
00:40:11.520 and together they combine the Synchro
00:40:13.980 Summon bartload Savage dragon
00:40:16.560 beautifully played by Paulie and you can
00:40:19.260 see Juana
00:40:20.880 it's mining it I mean he knows he is I
00:40:23.220 mean it's an amazing opponent and now
00:40:25.320 one draw away from what could be the
00:40:28.079 last game of the World Championship 2023
00:40:32.760 thinking back on all those achievements
00:40:34.500 that Paulie has had just this year
00:40:37.040 150th ycs
00:40:39.599 in Los Angeles
00:40:41.400 probably the biggest Tournament of his
00:40:43.020 life till now
00:40:45.900 okay I just there are no I have no words
00:40:51.680 you mentioned it Paulie has been a
00:40:54.060 veteran in the game but sometimes you
00:40:55.800 have those players who are missing that
00:40:57.480 performance and sometimes in just a
00:41:00.300 single year everything changes it's
00:41:02.099 you're here you're here after winning a
00:41:05.040 lot of different events and what a way
00:41:07.200 to end it and Polly did he did normal
00:41:09.000 summon that rocket recharger it wasn't a
00:41:11.099 rocket that was destroyed right or a
00:41:12.599 dark dragon yep he did normal summon it
00:41:14.640 so no big issues here and the way to his
00:41:18.420 Victory lap
00:41:21.720 here
00:41:29.520 one more draw
00:41:32.099 this could be will it be the handshake
00:41:34.320 did he draw into something he can use
00:41:35.579 Dark Ruler no more maybe
00:41:38.040 that's it
00:41:39.960 it's over we have our first ever world
00:41:43.680 champion from the United States of
00:41:45.780 America Paulie Aronson
00:41:49.560 wow
00:41:50.839 what a way to end it you mentioned it
00:41:53.820 first time that is happening USA as a
00:41:57.780 world champion for PCG ocg
00:42:01.400 Championship 2023 OCT
