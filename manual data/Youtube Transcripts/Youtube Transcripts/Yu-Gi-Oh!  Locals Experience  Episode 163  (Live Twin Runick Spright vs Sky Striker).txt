00:10:51.839 eventually I'm gonna get all the cars
00:10:53.640 left in your deck eventually half of me
00:10:55.800 just wondering if you just wanted to see
00:10:57.120 it all right so I had it I had another I
00:10:59.640 had the freezing curses it's exactly
00:11:01.260 three but you have to summon a monster
00:11:02.820 these are the last three oh my Lord
00:11:05.480 that's fair that's fair uh because I was
00:11:08.339 like I opened all runic spells and I was
00:11:11.459 like
00:11:12.180 well
00:11:13.500 all right I mean it worked I'll say
00:11:15.899 either I ain't gonna play
00:11:26.120 but they don't do anything okay
00:11:29.459 um
00:11:45.779 yes
00:11:53.339 let's go for

00:12:55.860 it it was very good once it gets going
00:12:57.300 it gets going like it's hard to stop
00:12:58.620 because you have the sky starter spells
00:13:00.180 and the running spells and you draw a
00:13:01.320 bunch of cards I feel like those cards
00:13:02.639 together it's just
00:13:04.519 it's not bad it's just very weird
