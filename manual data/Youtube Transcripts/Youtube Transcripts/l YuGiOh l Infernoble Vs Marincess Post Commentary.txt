00:00:00.080 what is up guys this is Charles from
00:00:01.079 Team Cog and today guys I'm coming at
00:00:02.760 you with another post commentary dual
00:00:05.040 video from our live stream that happened
00:00:06.560 at locals this weekend again I'm just
00:00:08.320 going over all the matches because you
00:00:10.040 guys wanted the the camera to follow me
00:00:11.920 I know sometimes you guys like have or
00:00:13.880 at least I don't know like I've thought
00:00:15.320 like sometimes a table one feature mat
00:00:16.800 getting different decks and stuff like
00:00:17.960 that's pretty cool but then also I also
00:00:19.400 know like sometimes you guys like to
00:00:20.600 follow me so that's what we're doing
00:00:22.240 here and we're going over the commentary
00:00:24.760 uh from that live stream from that
00:00:26.560 locals to uh see what we could on
00:00:28.519 different look at plays and all that
00:00:29.640 type of stuff and fun fact I was showed
00:00:31.320 up to work this morning at 6:00 and I
00:00:33.399 didn't actually have to work so we're
00:00:34.559 still doing this still dressed for work
00:00:37.040 but anyway this is round two at locals

00:00:47.840 that join button it goes a long way
00:00:49.879 Channel's been kind of going through
00:00:50.800 like a dry spot in a little bit just
00:00:52.000 because of work and everything like that
00:00:53.680 but we're still trying to uh put out
00:00:56.239 some infer Noble content for you guys
00:00:58.399 just and yeah just just because we love
00:01:00.600 infin Noy so anyway let's go ahead and
00:01:01.840 start out here I don't think I lost a
00:01:04.040 single dice roll all night long like all
00:01:06.880 night I wanton all my dice rolls which
00:01:08.400 was insane but uh so we end up going
00:01:10.080 first here against marinees and we get
00:01:12.560 to do I I think so marinees is not
00:01:14.720 really especially winning the die roll
00:01:16.280 right uh like truly Inferno winning the
00:01:18.560 die roll like as soon as we win the die
00:01:19.960 roll like the chances of us winning like
00:01:21.960 go like significantly uh ahead which is
00:01:24.799 wild to think that you know by winning
00:01:26.280 the dice roll our chances of winning the
00:01:28.880 whole game is Just trend tremendous
00:01:31.119 however it doesn't always mean that's
00:01:32.439 going to happen so I think in my hand I
00:01:34.840 have um sha badine a few other cards so
00:01:37.439 I end up paying 12 and if you guys
00:01:39.520 checked out the last video you guys will
00:01:40.960 have noticed that as I promised we have
00:01:43.520 slid down so now like we get the whole
00:01:46.240 uh mat and even the next the the next
00:01:48.799 match will be even better in frame but
00:01:50.159 so we set a card you never guess what it
00:01:52.159 is the only trap we play in the deck
00:01:53.399 which is Shay brigandine my favorite
00:01:55.520 trap in the like probably in the game
00:01:58.600 actually so we go ahead and we I believe
00:02:02.360 we fire off durendal y so we equip
00:02:05.399 durall we attempt to use durandal's
00:02:07.119 effect here and he does have an ash
00:02:09.119 Blossom which is pretty solid hit like I
00:02:12.959 mean like hitting durendal is kind of
00:02:14.519 rough because like it like restricts us
00:02:16.440 from later on using durendal or doing
00:02:18.280 what we need so he's going to fire off
00:02:19.319 Ash Blossom
00:02:20.599 here and that just means the durall does
00:02:22.760 not get destroyed we don't get to add
00:02:24.720 but I believe we also have um one for
00:02:28.440 one pitching the Roland which is an
00:02:31.519 insane pitch to be honest with you being
00:02:33.680 able to pitch the Roland it allows us to
00:02:36.160 you know go ahead and guarantee that
00:02:38.080 we're going to get that angel Ang
00:02:39.760 Angelic ring Angelica's ring excuse me
00:02:42.200 gosh uh in the in phas which is going to
00:02:44.560 like pretty much give us another solid
00:02:45.920 form of disruption but I'm just trying
00:02:48.040 to contemplate if we summon out Breck
00:02:52.200 yardo which I guess so and we use rard
00:02:54.720 bring back the rolling if we wanted to
00:02:56.000 or we just hold it we don't use the
00:02:57.280 effect because if we use ri's effect
00:02:58.879 that Warrior locks us so maybe that's
00:03:00.840 what I was saying now see again again
00:03:02.360 guys if you guys saw the last video a
00:03:04.000 one for one should if you still follow
00:03:05.400 the whole Snake Eyes build and
00:03:06.319 everything like that one for one should
00:03:07.319 be popular I would have opened popular
00:03:09.400 again so again that's just to prove to
00:03:12.200 you guys like I'm not crazy I'm not just
00:03:13.440 making up these scenarios like it truly
00:03:15.159 happened like I would see if one for one
00:03:16.840 was popular I'd be seeing it way too
00:03:18.159 many times so we end up Synchro for five
00:03:20.720 here into Angelica Angelica is going to
00:03:22.799 get us another copy of the museum now I
00:03:25.920 don't know right off the top of my head
00:03:27.920 I think since I already attempted to use
00:03:29.200 the darll regardless of it resolved or
00:03:31.200 not I can't use the second effect
00:03:33.360 otherwise we would use it but we're
00:03:34.599 going ahead and go and use joyous cuz we
00:03:35.680 hard open joyous chain Angelica Angelica
00:03:37.640 effect to send I believe right here we
00:03:39.640 go ahead and we send Oar and then Oar
00:03:42.360 and stuff like that so this is like the
00:03:43.400 same Bread Butter com I'd like to do
00:03:44.560 like a combo video showcasing it's
00:03:45.959 pretty much if you have any of theel any
00:03:47.920 level four and like level four period
00:03:50.799 fire warrior uh plus access to durendal
00:03:54.760 which that means your three museums your
00:03:55.879 three Heritage and your durendal uh you
00:03:57.799 have a combo that gets you to Charles
00:03:59.319 and gear
00:04:00.280 and it's just like one of the the crazy
00:04:01.799 things that like I think like you should
00:04:03.879 know as a player that any level four
00:04:05.720 plus Heritage or plus Museum gets you
00:04:08.799 to uh this combo so it's like I might do
00:04:11.079 a video of it later just showcasing it
00:04:12.720 just so people like have it in their
00:04:14.000 reservoir of knowledge uh but we go Oar
00:04:16.798 Target and then we go Museum effect to
00:04:18.839 move forward o gear descend since we go
00:04:21.000 ahead and and this is pretty much what
00:04:22.680 this is right
00:04:25.080 um however in the case of shabber gine
00:04:28.560 it's It's kind of the same same same
00:04:29.880 laws of physics essentially the laws of
00:04:31.720 physics still apply here we just had to
00:04:32.840 maneuver away a little bit differently
00:04:33.840 but any other level four plus access to
00:04:35.720 durendal which we had that because of um
00:04:39.120 Museum uh would get us to the this combo
00:04:41.400 we're going to be able to get to so we
00:04:42.240 go chain link one chain link two chain
00:04:43.479 link two will add back the gear freed
00:04:44.759 and then chain link one will add us the
00:04:47.680 uh we equip the Charles and then we can
00:04:50.320 move up I think we get to move forward
00:04:51.840 the Charles yeah we can move forward the
00:04:53.160 Charles cuz we had access to Almas
00:04:54.479 Roland equipped double Charles gear
00:04:56.280 freed through the ash Blossom which
00:04:58.000 would arguably seem like
00:05:00.160 Ash is one of those cards where like
00:05:01.600 it's either low impact or it's high
00:05:02.840 impact um and I I mean that by maybe
00:05:05.479 it's like the same for like other
00:05:06.759 strategies and stuff like that but uh
00:05:08.800 for the most part if we have a bad hand
00:05:11.840 one Ash can kill us but if you have a
00:05:13.639 mediocre to well hand one hand trap's
00:05:15.520 not going to be enough to stop what you
00:05:17.000 know what what this deck can do um and
00:05:19.319 then like hindsights also like there's
00:05:20.759 certain choke points in the combo like
00:05:22.360 sometimes like you guys will know like
00:05:23.360 you start out with Heritage of chalice
00:05:24.520 and it's like if they Ash Heritage or
00:05:25.880 turns over but since they didn't Ash
00:05:27.720 Heritage we're able to play through Ash
00:05:30.080 now which is just kind of like the
00:05:31.319 variance of sequencing and the variance
00:05:32.759 of and the variables that play in right
00:05:34.600 where it's like ash on my normal St
00:05:35.919 would have end in my turn but since they
00:05:37.080 held Ash hit me at a different time I'm
00:05:38.600 able to play through it better than I
00:05:39.919 would have before but this is our in
00:05:42.240 board here we have double Charles Angel
00:05:44.120 ring and gear freed so pretty much two
00:05:45.680 spell and trap negates or yeah two spell
00:05:48.160 and trap negates a spell negate a
00:05:49.440 monster effect negate and a pop and then
00:05:51.639 of course um if we CH choose we could
00:05:53.960 trigger Angelica to tag out and do some
00:05:55.560 things I don't know what would be the
00:05:56.720 point of tagging out Angelica especially
00:05:58.000 at this point since like Dempsey is not
00:05:59.240 in the graveyard yard but anyway we're
00:06:01.400 looking at Marine test here and Marine
00:06:02.639 test really doesn't have I'm trying to
00:06:04.039 look at his hand it looks like his
00:06:05.520 second Ash Blossom he drew a
00:06:08.000 seahorse but he does smack down dark a
00:06:10.240 little more which we just got to let
00:06:11.960 Angel ring get that and it just looks
00:06:13.520 like he has like ash plus the um I think
00:06:18.840 that's Ash Ash plus seahorse plus the
00:06:21.560 field spell which is not good you never
00:06:23.000 want to see the field spell and it just
00:06:24.440 kind of
00:06:25.280 looks like like I know marinees does
00:06:27.919 have the ability to extend depending on
00:06:29.039 the hand but like seeing I like seeing
00:06:31.639 go he does he does have blue tang I
00:06:33.800 don't so he could like normal blue tang
00:06:37.000 but instead he normals the seahorse and
00:06:39.080 I was like okay on on normal summon
00:06:40.479 rolling effect to equip I don't
00:06:43.000 understand why he didn't is there any
00:06:44.960 like Marine say he could have sent with
00:06:46.479 blue tang that have done better so we
00:06:49.400 use a Charles effect to pop we draw for
00:06:50.919 turn this is enough for damage this is
00:06:52.440 369 35 35 4,000 or 45 actually and we
00:06:58.000 just move on into the next game I don't
00:06:59.879 know if there's like I I try to stay
00:07:02.080 fluent with a lot of decks as I can I
00:07:03.479 don't know if blue tang I don't think
00:07:04.680 there's a single card they could have
00:07:06.000 sent with blue tang maybe does the one
00:07:09.039 that the not mandrin the one that you
00:07:12.400 normal summon a special from the hand
00:07:13.960 does that have like a graveyard effect
00:07:15.120 or
00:07:16.560 something cuz no matter what is they
00:07:18.560 commit the normal Stone was getting
00:07:19.800 popped because that puts them on having
00:07:21.199 spring girl but I had giing to check a
00:07:22.680 spring girl so that really put him on
00:07:24.599 having something insane and if it was
00:07:26.599 something like sinet mining or like
00:07:28.120 anything like that the two chares could
00:07:29.520 answered it so I don't think there's
00:07:30.560 really anything he would have done there
00:07:32.120 maybe his thought process was hold the
00:07:33.560 blue tank cuz it's the best normal
00:07:34.680 summon under this you know like whole
00:07:36.360 blue tang normal summon if it gets this
00:07:38.120 gets popped he could like do something
00:07:40.039 but even like even then cuz it's like
00:07:42.680 normal seahorse addback seahorse I guess
00:07:44.919 I see it I mean like yeah I can see it
00:07:47.400 but we'll go on into the next game here
00:07:49.319 and it looks like his opening hand is
00:07:51.400 not that good again one one name and it
00:07:53.919 looks like it's the worst name it looks
00:07:54.919 like it's Mandarin and I was just
00:07:56.840 showing my buddy sitting next to me
00:07:57.840 Caleb I just saw World Legacy success
00:07:59.840 again so like if I you guys don't
00:08:01.120 remember the last video I said that I
00:08:02.520 was just seeing succession
00:08:04.520 nonstop like I it was it was insane like
00:08:07.479 statistically you should not see this
00:08:08.800 card as many times as I did but he
00:08:09.960 normal summons mandrin and you know if
00:08:11.440 mandrin the normal summon it's rough
00:08:14.479 because that means you have literally
00:08:16.560 nothing
00:08:17.560 else nothing else and he links off into
00:08:19.879 blue slug I guess he a blue slug effect
00:08:21.720 to add here however we get to look back
00:08:23.720 at his hand I look at like I let see
00:08:25.159 here he has pot of avarest let's see if
00:08:26.639 we can pause it here and look at his
00:08:27.560 hand he has dive pot of aers Dark Ruler
00:08:30.639 and some other unknown and um looking
00:08:33.519 back at it you know he's very new he's
00:08:35.120 newish to the deck uh you could have
00:08:37.080 normal summon made the seahorse or made
00:08:39.519 the the angel whatever that one is Angel
00:08:41.679 grabbed the field spell activate the
00:08:43.479 field spell use dive dive summon from
00:08:44.959 the deck like blue tang or something and
00:08:46.320 then he could have comboed that way but
00:08:48.000 if you're not too familiar with your
00:08:49.519 deck you know if you don't understand
00:08:50.600 those lines especially sometimes seeing
00:08:52.240 like mandrin and like I guess it goes
00:08:53.760 for like any other strategy sometimes
00:08:54.920 you see the oneof card you never want to
00:08:56.160 see it kind of frazzle you and you don't
00:08:57.680 you don't think the hand is playable but
00:08:58.959 it actually turns turns out to be
00:08:59.880 playable Dark Ruler I'm trying to see
00:09:01.800 and then he has tactics in hand too so
00:09:03.640 hypothetically like if I would have saw
00:09:04.959 a hand trap which I don't I haven't seen
00:09:06.959 I've since this locals I've upped my um
00:09:11.320 non-engine count it's it puts my it's
00:09:13.640 been put it puts my main Deck Over 40
00:09:16.360 which I don't really like but it just
00:09:17.680 puts it at a flat 43 and there's
00:09:19.279 arguably cards you could take out to
00:09:20.640 make it 40 but I just kept having an
00:09:22.920 issue in the previous list where I did
00:09:24.959 when I was doing the Singleton names
00:09:26.320 where I just would always not see like
00:09:28.800 it was just pretty much open upper
00:09:29.959 cutter or bust because you just couldn't
00:09:31.399 guarantee to see anything and I'd see a
00:09:33.240 lot of non-engine when I just needed to
00:09:34.760 see like the perfect ratio just two non-
00:09:36.760 engine and three engine cards but anyway
00:09:38.560 we're get to go here and I go here to
00:09:40.040 the Chalice to grab the um o gear and
00:09:44.000 this right here is the anti hand trap
00:09:45.600 line which is kind of
00:09:47.079 nice normal Zone o gear o gear will send
00:09:49.480 gear freed and this is also why I I
00:09:51.640 think that if you're going to play any
00:09:53.480 of the infin noble names at more than
00:09:54.920 just one it should be Renault and oar uh
00:09:58.480 because oar I I believe Patrick hin put
00:10:01.200 it in a book but he was saying like five
00:10:02.720 normal summons is really good so if you
00:10:04.079 have three upper Cutter Plus two o gear
00:10:06.360 that's like fits the five normal summon
00:10:07.640 ratio that you want to see I don't know
00:10:09.640 if that logic still holds up but we open
00:10:11.640 joyous to Charles's blade we end up
00:10:13.399 using joyous to add back the gear freed
00:10:14.800 and then we banish to go ahead and
00:10:16.839 summon out the gear freed and then that
00:10:18.600 way I can special out the um Renault
00:10:21.600 Rena add back the joyous and then I have
00:10:23.160 the ability to use joyous to trigger the
00:10:25.880 Angelica here and then of course you
00:10:28.240 what you do is um gear equipped to the
00:10:31.760 Gear freed and then like you can resolve
00:10:33.079 Angelica's effect to like move through I
00:10:35.560 mean yes if he ashes here like it's
00:10:36.920 still rough but we would still be able
00:10:38.040 to combo through getting ashed here uh
00:10:40.560 simply if we didn't get access to museum
00:10:41.760 because we have the equip spell in hand
00:10:43.200 we could still trigger off the Angelica
00:10:45.560 and uh do things like that so anyway o
00:10:47.240 gear equipped to gear freed and uh yeah
00:10:49.040 we just kind of have to we just got to
00:10:50.120 put on damage now and sometimes like you
00:10:52.440 always I I'll lose I'll get lost in the
00:10:53.880 sauce and I'll forget that like oh I'm
00:10:55.399 going second especially with these like
00:10:57.600 subar boards at sometime or the sub
00:10:59.399 openings that some decks will have just
00:11:00.760 because of just you know variants and
00:11:02.040 stuff like that I'll be like oh wait
00:11:03.200 never mind I'm not going first uh so we
00:11:05.480 end up just linking off or using
00:11:06.680 Angelica to tag out into
00:11:08.440 Roland and then of course uh tping can
00:11:11.200 special summon itself I have succession
00:11:12.720 in hand again that's just to me guys
00:11:14.480 like I truly I'm not lying to you guys
00:11:15.800 we I wish we would I should have started
00:11:17.320 to count at the beginning of at the
00:11:18.600 start of the stretch of videos to show
00:11:20.120 you guys how much or how many times we
00:11:22.320 opened uh succession roll and Equip to
00:11:25.079 Charles Charles will destroy the uh the
00:11:27.000 slug we go into blueo Charles the EMP
00:11:29.600 the card that should have been called
00:11:30.480 charlot M but for some reason Konami
00:11:32.160 decided to not do that we activate we
00:11:34.399 activate the field spell now to go ahead
00:11:36.320 and search us an equip spell which I
00:11:39.440 don't know why what we could even grab
00:11:41.680 here to be honest with you gear freed
00:11:43.639 would I mean like right here we have
00:11:44.760 6,000 some damage technically we have
00:11:46.920 7,000 damage because 35 and 35 so we're
00:11:50.240 just trying to get to enough to oh we
00:11:52.639 have damage because I go field spell
00:11:54.120 move up yeah field spell move up Charles
00:11:56.519 and then I can I we don't even have to
00:11:58.440 like I don't even have to go this far I
00:12:00.639 could have just gone moved up Charles
00:12:02.120 and then just attacked with Synchro
00:12:03.320 Charles blue Charles and gear freed that
00:12:04.720 would have been enough
00:12:06.000 for damage there but I think I just do
00:12:08.880 this because I don't know what he has in
00:12:09.920 his hand I know Marine is known to play
00:12:11.200 hand trap so like maybe he has like a
00:12:13.040 nib or something like that maybe he has
00:12:14.199 like hand traps to fle my way but anyway
00:12:16.480 this is it that's all that he could do
00:12:18.519 we end up throwing through pushing
00:12:20.079 through through game here and yeah so
00:12:22.920 that's it for this round guys U this was
00:12:24.720 round two stay tuned for round three and
00:12:26.440 round four and he shows us he's shown
00:12:28.000 the hand here and I I was like oh wait
00:12:30.880 like dive and stuff like that would have
00:12:33.680 got him where he needed to go I don't
00:12:35.440 know if it would have been able to like
00:12:36.880 if he' been able to put up like a big
00:12:38.040 enough board to stop me I know like he
00:12:39.519 would have maybe gotten to wave which
00:12:41.040 wave is just an iner and I feel like we
00:12:42.519 could successfully play through wave and
00:12:44.800 we'd been able to actually like solve
00:12:46.240 like a lot of the issues like he might
00:12:47.800 have been able to get to like I know the
00:12:49.199 field spell boost attack and stuff like
00:12:50.680 that but like Charles could have popped
00:12:51.800 the field spell and then we could have
00:12:52.720 beat over whatever and do things like
00:12:55.079 that but anyway guys most importantly
00:12:57.480 for you guys out there stay safe stay
00:12:58.760 healthy this is Charleston team CG
