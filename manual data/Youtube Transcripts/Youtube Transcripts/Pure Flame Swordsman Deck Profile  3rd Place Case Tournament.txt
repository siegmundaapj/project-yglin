00:00:01.040 hey everybody how's it going it's peeps
00:00:02.919 here I wanted to post a video of my pure
00:00:07.319 Flame Swordsman Deck Profile that got
00:00:09.519 third place at my local case tournament
00:00:13.639 I was pretty impressed with it actually
00:00:15.440 was surprising because there were a lot
00:00:17.199 of good players at that case tournament
00:00:18.760 and this is a you know very Rogue uh
00:00:21.960 mid-range kind of style of deck so I
00:00:24.199 wasn't anticipating it doing too well
00:00:25.880 but it
00:00:26.880 honestly outdid my expectations by a lot
00:00:30.240 it is a really cool strategy um no
00:00:33.559 infernoble combos here baby it is pure
00:00:36.920 summoning the OG summoning the big guy
00:00:40.000 you know the the big ultimate Flame
00:00:41.800 Swordsman and that's it so it was really
00:00:44.920 fun um and I actually think it's pretty
00:00:47.239 good I'm going to keep playing it this
00:00:48.399 format moving into the new meta and
00:00:51.360 taking it to Regionals stuff like that
00:00:52.640 because I actually like I said it was
00:00:53.719 really impressed with it so uh let's
00:00:56.840 show off what I played and talk about
00:00:59.280 why I played it it and what the deck
00:01:01.440 does that kind of stuff I'll show off
00:01:03.120 the cards but I will do like some basic
00:01:05.680 combos talk about why um what changes
00:01:09.200 I'm going to make and things you can do
00:01:11.200 with the deck with certain hands so uh
00:01:13.320 to start off three fighting flame
00:01:15.520 Swordsmen this is like the most
00:01:16.880 important card of the deck it is a card
00:01:18.799 you want to be opening with searching
00:01:21.159 for starting your plays with every time
00:01:23.920 it is a phenomenal card when it's normal
00:01:26.280 or special that adds a Flame Swordsman
00:01:27.920 spell trap or a spell trap that mentions
00:01:30.000 swordsman from your deck to your hand
00:01:32.079 and then when it sends to the graveyard
00:01:33.600 it sends a um send a Flame Swordsman or
00:01:37.640 monster that mentions it from your deck
00:01:39.240 or extra deck to the graveyard so the
00:01:41.560 card you are typically sending with that
00:01:44.159 effect is salamander the flying flame
00:01:47.040 dragon I played two of this this is a
00:01:48.840 mistake I should have been playing three
00:01:50.719 uh the reason you want to be playing
00:01:52.479 three of this is because you kind of do
00:01:55.759 want to open it alongside fighting Flame
00:01:58.079 Swordsman so that way what you can do
00:02:00.560 is you can chain block the effect or the
00:02:04.119 salamander effect well let me explain
00:02:05.600 what it does um you can equip it to a
00:02:09.038 Flame Swordsman or monster that mentions
00:02:10.560 it or sorry you can Target a warrior
00:02:12.360 monster control equip this card from
00:02:13.879 your hand or graveyard to it uh as an
00:02:16.959 equip spell and then when it's sent to
00:02:19.360 the Grave you can search for a
00:02:20.959 salamander Spell trap so you want to
00:02:24.879 have this plus this so you use the
00:02:26.879 effect equipped to this and then when
00:02:29.040 you use flam swords realm which is the
00:02:31.000 spell that summons the OG Flame
00:02:32.280 Swordsman we'll get to that in a bit um
00:02:34.599 you can go chain link one salamandra
00:02:36.920 chain link 2 fighting Flame Swordsman so
00:02:39.760 uh you can use the fighting Flame
00:02:40.840 Swordsman to dump the fusion Dragon
00:02:42.959 instead of this one because of course
00:02:44.360 you already have this one and then you
00:02:46.440 can use this uh it'll be chain blocked
00:02:48.239 to search the fusion spell so um I
00:02:50.239 should have been playing three and I
00:02:51.360 should not have been playing this card I
00:02:53.080 played to oier the reason I played to
00:02:55.360 oier is because I wanted extra normal
00:02:59.239 summons because this is a very new
00:03:01.280 archetype it is currently lacking engine
00:03:03.599 pieces so I thought oier was like the
00:03:05.840 next best
00:03:06.840 thing but Oar on its own is not full
00:03:09.400 combo you need other pieces of The Flame
00:03:12.239 Swordsman engine in order to have this
00:03:15.239 be a substitute for this and honestly I
00:03:18.360 would have just preferred to play more
00:03:19.760 copies of this and cut this and have
00:03:21.440 another slot for non-engine to be honest
00:03:23.319 so um this card was fine it does have an
00:03:26.519 effect where you can equip it to a fire
00:03:29.040 warrior and then that card can't be
00:03:31.080 destroyed by card effects so you can use
00:03:32.799 it to equip to your big Flame Swordsman
00:03:35.959 uh the big Flame Swordsman the ultimate
00:03:37.360 Flame Swordsman has an effect where it
00:03:40.319 destroys itself in the end phase if you
00:03:42.560 use the effect to boost in the damage
00:03:44.599 step so this can save it from that but
00:03:47.319 honestly if you're using that effect
00:03:48.599 you're just winning the game anyway so
00:03:49.879 you really don't need this uh it was
00:03:51.920 redundant when you open both of these
00:03:54.319 it's clunky you don't really add
00:03:56.120 anything to the boards by opening this
00:03:58.079 and this uh where you you do when you
00:04:00.400 open this and this and even if you open
00:04:03.560 just this you can normal summon it link
00:04:06.239 it into Al marage and then use the
00:04:08.560 effect to search for salamander with
00:04:10.360 chain and alaraj is a fire so that makes
00:04:13.480 salamander with chain live so it's not
00:04:15.400 like a great opening by any means but it
00:04:17.560 still does something whereas oier really
00:04:22.040 does a still pretty bad opening if you
00:04:24.280 don't have the rest of the Flame
00:04:25.199 Swordsman pieces so um at the end of the
00:04:27.720 day basically I'm going to cut oier and
00:04:29.639 put in a third one of this cuz it's not
00:04:31.320 terrible to open especially if you
00:04:33.240 already have your engine
00:04:35.199 rolling and as you can see that's it for
00:04:37.919 the monsters that's it and I'm going to
00:04:40.759 cut o gear so it's going to be even less
00:04:42.479 it's going to be six main deck engine
00:04:44.639 monsters is that can you believe it
00:04:46.400 that's a beautiful site hardly any
00:04:48.400 normal summons here uh so I'm I'm pretty
00:04:50.800 excited about that uh the next is one
00:04:53.759 reinforcement of the army and three of
00:04:57.360 one of the best cards I've ever read
00:04:58.560 fighting flame sword
00:05:00.440 so this is the archetypal Searcher uh
00:05:03.360 it's got three effects so activate one
00:05:05.280 of these effects at and it's a quick
00:05:06.680 play spell by the way it says add one
00:05:08.639 card from your deck to your hand that
00:05:09.680 mentions Flame Swordsman except fighting
00:05:11.240 flame sword or when an attack is
00:05:13.240 declared involving a fire warrior
00:05:14.520 monster you control you can Target one
00:05:16.000 card in the field destroy it or when
00:05:18.199 your opponent activates a cter effect
00:05:19.639 that targets Flame Swordsman or a
00:05:21.039 monster that mentions it that you
00:05:22.800 control negate that effect you can only
00:05:24.520 activate one of these per turn so those
00:05:26.919 last two effects seems like they would
00:05:28.520 never come up you would Ty be using this
00:05:30.280 to search and most of the time you are
00:05:32.199 using this to search but those effects
00:05:34.639 are actually pretty relevant um if
00:05:36.400 they're trying to Target your ultimate
00:05:37.639 flame Swordsmen you can have a fighting
00:05:39.639 flame sword in the back to protect it
00:05:41.400 from whatever those effects are like an
00:05:42.680 imperm or something like that so it does
00:05:44.479 come up and I did use those secondary
00:05:47.360 effects a couple times throughout the
00:05:49.199 tournament so don't ever forget them
00:05:51.800 they're good then one of the other best
00:05:54.800 cards in the deck here is flame swords
00:05:57.319 realm so this card is super super good
00:06:00.039 I'm going to explain what it does this
00:06:02.360 card is a continuous spell it reads your
00:06:04.039 opponent cannot activate cards or
00:06:05.319 effects when you normal summon a fire
00:06:06.680 warrior monster once per turn you can
00:06:09.520 send one monster from your hand or face
00:06:11.160 up field to the graveyard special summon
00:06:13.039 One Flame Swordsman from your extra deck
00:06:14.520 it's treated as a fusion and then once
00:06:16.639 per turn when a monster declares an
00:06:18.080 attack that's any monster either your as
00:06:19.840 your opponents you can Target one
00:06:21.440 warrior monster you control until the
00:06:23.120 end of this turn it loses a th000 but
00:06:25.000 all other monsters you control gain a
00:06:26.960 th000 so this effect is really good and
00:06:29.520 this card gets out of hand a lot uh
00:06:31.360 notably these effects are once per turn
00:06:33.880 per copy so it is beneficial to have
00:06:36.319 multiples of them and it targets any
00:06:40.199 Warrior not just a fire warrior or not
00:06:42.479 just any Warrior that mentions Flame
00:06:44.639 Swordsman so you can Target something
00:06:46.680 like an SP little Knight or a baron uh
00:06:48.800 to reduce its attack to make your other
00:06:50.160 stuff gain
00:06:51.440 so also if you have something like Baron
00:06:54.400 or like SP little Knight plus OG Flame
00:06:56.840 Swordsman or ultimate Flame Swordsman
00:06:59.000 and this on the board it makes SP little
00:07:01.080 Knight way harder to out because instead
00:07:03.240 of being a 1600 it becomes a 2600 you
00:07:05.879 know a lot of people will try to out SP
00:07:07.400 little Knight by just normal something U
00:07:09.080 normal summoning something and not
00:07:10.280 activating any effects and then moving
00:07:11.440 to the battle phase well this prevents
00:07:13.720 them from outing the SP little Knight
00:07:15.440 that way so really really good card um
00:07:18.680 it's one of the main pieces of your one
00:07:20.280 card combo to summon ultimate Flame
00:07:21.759 Swordsman as
00:07:24.000 well then I played two salamander Fusion
00:07:28.879 so this this is not a sometimes not all
00:07:30.720 the time situation the the reason for
00:07:32.919 playing two of this is because you want
00:07:35.440 one to search on your turn one combo and
00:07:39.720 then you want the second one in deck to
00:07:41.680 be able to summon a second ultimate
00:07:43.680 Flame Swordsman throughout the game so
00:07:46.479 um it's not good enough to play three of
00:07:48.960 but it definitely you know you just you
00:07:51.000 want one for turn one and you want one
00:07:52.680 for turn three right that's just you
00:07:54.159 know that's why you play it that
00:07:57.360 way and then the last two archetypal
00:08:00.479 cards this is my biggest mistake in deck
00:08:02.759 building by the way besides the oars um
00:08:05.039 this is one flame Swords Dance and one
00:08:06.919 salamandra with chain big mistake was
00:08:09.080 that I needed to be playing way more of
00:08:11.240 these um these cards are extremely good
00:08:15.000 this the pure variant of this deck is
00:08:16.800 built you know it has so much space for
00:08:19.000 non-engine that you are creating
00:08:21.720 simplified game States all the time with
00:08:23.840 this so when you have simplified game
00:08:25.800 States and then you have these on the
00:08:27.240 board these cards are crazy um I'll read
00:08:30.039 flame Swords Dance first it says if a
00:08:32.279 monster special summon special summon a
00:08:34.000 level seven or lower Fusion Monster from
00:08:35.399 your extra deck that his flame swords
00:08:36.640 Min mentions it then you can change one
00:08:38.559 face up monster on the field to face
00:08:39.719 down defense position couple things
00:08:41.440 about this effect it is not once per
00:08:43.080 turn it does not Target so you are
00:08:45.920 summoning something from your extra deck
00:08:47.320 and you are booking a card in the field
00:08:48.920 which is nuts and then it has an
00:08:51.160 effective Fusion summon from the grave
00:08:52.560 this one doesn't come up that much uh
00:08:54.519 you have to Tribute a face down card
00:08:56.480 during your opponent's battle phase but
00:08:58.720 it does does come up it it you can use
00:09:01.839 that effect and it becomes way more live
00:09:04.519 if you have multiple copies of this card
00:09:06.920 because this targets to a fire and then
00:09:08.680 books a monster on the field and you can
00:09:10.880 do that at any time not just when you're
00:09:13.040 not just when a monster is special
00:09:14.200 summoned so um this card does not
00:09:17.800 mention Flame Swordsman so really the
00:09:19.360 only way you're searching this is with
00:09:21.040 the salamandra main Deck monster um but
00:09:24.000 this card's crazy it targets a fire
00:09:26.440 monster on the field equip this card to
00:09:28.000 it as an equip card that gives us 100
00:09:29.920 then you can change one effect monster
00:09:31.320 on the field to face down defense
00:09:32.560 position so again you target a fire
00:09:35.720 monster on the field but the booking
00:09:37.600 effect does not Target so you can Target
00:09:40.000 your opponent's fire monsters to then
00:09:41.720 book something right uh really good
00:09:44.160 card and then it has an effective fuse
00:09:46.320 in the grave as well by shuffling back
00:09:48.120 materials
00:09:49.720 so yeah these cards were just nuts um I
00:09:52.800 played a going first card in the main
00:09:55.079 deck in this
00:09:56.360 list uh but I should have I I shouldn't
00:09:58.560 have been playing that and I should have
00:09:59.640 just been playing multiples of this like
00:10:00.959 this card is definitely going to go to
00:10:02.279 three this card is really bad going
00:10:06.160 second so I might bump it to two or
00:10:08.959 maybe keep it at one uh I don't know but
00:10:11.640 it it's going to get it's going to get
00:10:12.920 bumped up and both of these cards are
00:10:14.399 going to get bumped up for sure cuz they
00:10:15.640 were they were nuts all day like the
00:10:17.279 games I was winning throughout the
00:10:18.720 tournament regardless of what deck my
00:10:20.800 opponent was playing I was I was using
00:10:23.200 these trap cards and those are the cards
00:10:25.200 that were putting me ahead uh in the
00:10:26.959 game States so and and then um the last
00:10:30.000 piece of engine I guess is three pot of
00:10:31.839 prosperity um Prosperity is really good
00:10:34.240 because really the main starter you're
00:10:36.079 looking for is fighting Flame Swordsman
00:10:37.920 and you just you you want to dig for
00:10:39.600 that card you have six C seven copies of
00:10:42.000 it because you have three fighting flame
00:10:43.560 Swordsmen a Roa and three of the quick
00:10:45.240 playay spell so Prosperity has a really
00:10:47.040 high chance of getting you there uh it
00:10:48.639 just made sense to play this card so um
00:10:52.240 that is 21
00:10:54.560 engine uh which is soon to be 20 engine
00:10:57.680 cuz I'm going to cut the two oier and
00:10:59.200 put in a third copy of the salamandra so
00:11:01.800 it's going to be for this for this event
00:11:03.959 I played 21 engine and 19 on engine but
00:11:06.920 it's going to be split 2020 next time so
00:11:09.760 um but anyway I played three Fen reer uh
00:11:13.040 fener was really really strong obviously
00:11:17.240 because it's Fen rear like come on but
00:11:19.639 also it has you know it has an effect
00:11:23.040 where it puts more monsters in your hand
00:11:25.079 and when you have flame swords realm
00:11:26.680 plus this you can special Fen reer add
00:11:29.440 another Fen reer use the swords realm to
00:11:32.360 send the fener that you added and get an
00:11:33.880 OG Flame Swordsman that puts a fire on
00:11:35.560 the board which turns on your
00:11:36.680 salamandras and all that kind of stuff
00:11:38.440 so um simplify game States stuff like
00:11:41.240 this is really important when you're
00:11:42.360 constantly slapping uh bunch of vanillas
00:11:46.160 on the board and notably if you have
00:11:48.920 flame swords Rong plus this Fen rear you
00:11:51.680 know you put it in attack position
00:11:53.720 people will try to go to the battle
00:11:55.240 phase without activating effects to beat
00:11:56.760 over Fen reer while you have swords
00:11:58.120 realm so swords makes Ben 3,400 not just
00:12:01.200 2400 right so that continuous spell was
00:12:04.399 so good throughout the tournament I
00:12:06.399 swear so that's the first part for the
00:12:08.320 non- engine and then I played uh three
00:12:11.240 Ash and three
00:12:13.600 droll um I have so much space for
00:12:15.800 non-engine I wanted to play cards that
00:12:18.279 were going to create simplified game
00:12:19.639 States and allow me to pressure the
00:12:22.199 opponent um on weaker boards so droll
00:12:24.519 felt pretty good um obviously there are
00:12:27.880 matchups where it's bad but uh it felt
00:12:30.519 good to play it regardless and then I
00:12:33.320 played what I call Seven veiler deck
00:12:36.959 building Theory uh I played three veiler
00:12:39.760 a mner and three
00:12:41.320 imper so the reason I refer to it as
00:12:44.199 seven veiler theory is any combination
00:12:48.199 of these cards that you open if you open
00:12:50.440 multiples of any combination of these
00:12:52.440 they're all going to be live um I could
00:12:55.480 theoretically put another mner in here
00:12:57.519 to you know up the effect veiler count
00:13:00.160 but you can't activate multiple Ms per
00:13:01.600 turn so there is that small but there is
00:13:04.160 that chance where you could draw
00:13:05.320 multiples of this card and then it's not
00:13:07.040 live so um I just decided to play seven
00:13:10.800 that's still a really high chance of
00:13:12.160 drawing at least one or maybe even two
00:13:14.240 of these and they will always be online
00:13:16.399 you know because this deck is so low to
00:13:18.760 the ground you really want to minimize
00:13:21.240 the chance of clunking on non-engine
00:13:24.600 that you can't use multiples of um I
00:13:26.920 know I played three Ash and three droll
00:13:28.199 and theoretic that does have that
00:13:29.920 problem but you know it's Ash and droll
00:13:31.240 I'm going to take that risk with those
00:13:32.560 cards and then the last piece of
00:13:34.839 non-engine that I played was a weird one
00:13:36.920 I'm going to have some people that are
00:13:37.920 like what the heck uh but I played three
00:13:39.920 judgment in the main deck the card was
00:13:42.399 pretty good I'm not going to sit here
00:13:44.199 and try to say you know it's metad
00:13:46.000 defining you got to play this card I
00:13:48.320 played it for a very specific reason I
00:13:50.480 played it because this deck has a severe
00:13:53.519 weakness to Triple tactics
00:13:55.800 talent
00:13:57.639 and um um you know if they activate
00:14:00.560 talent and take the big guy the game's
00:14:02.839 pretty much over from there so I really
00:14:04.920 wanted something that was going to
00:14:07.360 handle that situation it was just a
00:14:09.360 piece that you know obviously if I was
00:14:11.000 going first and I open this can deal
00:14:13.199 with um you know multiple pieces of
00:14:15.399 engine that they have but I really
00:14:16.440 wanted to keep something in the deck to
00:14:18.040 beat talents and this was it this is
00:14:20.800 just the card that I picked and it was
00:14:22.079 good you know there were some games
00:14:23.560 where I won die rolls and open this card
00:14:25.600 so I got lucky and there were there was
00:14:27.800 like one game where I lost the die roll
00:14:30.279 in open judgment and it was rough to
00:14:32.360 play through there I think I still ended
00:14:33.720 up winning that game but um you know
00:14:36.360 there it's it's a risk in deck building
00:14:37.639 to play something like this I'm going to
00:14:39.639 move this to the side deck moving
00:14:40.800 forward um I think game one I just have
00:14:43.440 to take the risk of them having talent
00:14:46.000 and not necessarily building for that um
00:14:49.079 and I'm going to put more of the
00:14:50.600 archetypal traps in like two of these
00:14:52.320 are going to get cut for the flame
00:14:55.680 swords or the salamander with chain and
00:14:57.880 then maybe this will will get cut for
00:15:00.160 the uh flame Swords Dance you know maybe
00:15:03.440 I'll play three of it even I don't know
00:15:04.800 maybe I'll play three of each cuz those
00:15:05.920 cards were really good even going second
00:15:08.320 those cards are good but uh I know this
00:15:10.079 is definitely going to get moved to the
00:15:11.120 side and then I'll side it end for going
00:15:12.360 first for
00:15:13.320 sure I did like it though you know it
00:15:16.360 certainly wasn't I didn't feel bad
00:15:17.759 playing it
00:15:19.959 um then onto the extra deck so three of
00:15:25.000 the OG flame Swordsmen um I I got to say
00:15:29.360 it is so cool to play a deck in modern
00:15:31.759 Yu-Gi-Oh that summons this card and like
00:15:34.560 beats over boss monsters with this card
00:15:36.639 it was it was awesome I felt like I was
00:15:39.279 having like a bat chest Nostalgia moment
00:15:41.839 all throughout the day um summoning OG
00:15:45.319 Flame Swordsman and winning games with
00:15:47.319 it so um you do need to play three of it
00:15:51.440 it comes up a lot there were two games
00:15:53.759 throughout the tournament where um I
00:15:56.759 went through all three of them by by
00:15:58.800 turn three so even though it seems
00:16:01.440 ridiculous to have to play three of the
00:16:03.079 OG vanilla flame Swordsmen it's like
00:16:05.079 super important to have uh as many
00:16:07.279 copies as you can not having to
00:16:09.480 manufacture your game state where you're
00:16:11.160 intentionally like getting salamander
00:16:13.160 with chain and then using its Fusion
00:16:14.880 effect to shuffle it back just so you
00:16:16.399 have another one like you you just want
00:16:18.199 three of them an extra so did not feel
00:16:20.839 bad about
00:16:22.079 that uh then I played two ultimate flame
00:16:25.000 Swordsmen two felt fine two does come up
00:16:27.360 you want to summon one in your first
00:16:28.319 turn and go for another one on your
00:16:29.800 third turn um but uh yeah this this at
00:16:33.759 two felt pretty good um by the way for
00:16:36.120 those of you that don't know I'm going
00:16:37.000 to read what this card does because this
00:16:38.120 is like your main card that you're
00:16:39.680 summoning so this card says um it
00:16:42.000 requires Flame Swordsman and fighting
00:16:43.360 flame dragon um you can Target one
00:16:45.279 monster your opponent controls destroy
00:16:46.920 it and if you do inflict 500 to your
00:16:48.920 opponent this is a quick effect if this
00:16:50.360 card is equipped with an equip card at
00:16:52.680 the start of the damage step if this
00:16:53.800 card battles you can double this card's
00:16:55.319 attack until the end of this turn but if
00:16:56.920 you do destroy it during the end phase
00:16:58.279 of this this turn you could only use
00:16:59.480 each effect of fighting or ultimate
00:17:00.959 Flame Swordsman once per turn so um the
00:17:03.920 Fusion requirements don't really matter
00:17:05.559 the only time they matter is for the
00:17:06.760 salamander with chains grave effect um
00:17:09.240 this gets cheated out by the equip spell
00:17:11.000 the salamander Fusion so this card is
00:17:14.160 nuts it goes to like 8K attack or 10 I
00:17:18.000 think there were two games where I got
00:17:20.199 it to 10,400 attack because it had two
00:17:23.240 equip spells that gave it 700 and then I
00:17:25.760 used flame swords Realms boost effect on
00:17:27.959 a uh lowered a different card and
00:17:29.600 boosted this so it went to 52 uh and
00:17:31.840 then it can um boost itself to 10,400
00:17:35.160 and if it has this card on it it's a
00:17:36.640 double attacker so um this requires a
00:17:39.720 dragon monster and a fire warrior
00:17:41.440 monster you're really summoning this a
00:17:43.400 lot of the time off of the flame Swords
00:17:46.240 Dance um or you're sending it to the
00:17:48.480 Grave with fighting flame Swordsmen so
00:17:51.520 what this does is except they're in the
00:17:53.160 damage step it's a quick effect you can
00:17:54.600 Target a warrior Fusion you control
00:17:56.080 equip this card from your hand uh or
00:17:57.960 excuse me your field or graveyard to
00:17:59.480 that monster you control as an equip
00:18:00.640 spell you only use that once per turn
00:18:02.440 and then while this card is equipped to
00:18:03.640 a Flame Swordsman or monster that
00:18:04.799 mentions it the equip monster gains 700
00:18:06.840 attack it can make a second attack
00:18:08.159 during each battle phase so um you get
00:18:10.960 this on your big ultimate Flame
00:18:13.039 Swordsman and it attacks multiple times
00:18:16.240 with huge damage wow big numbers
00:18:19.520 woohoo um so that's it for the
00:18:22.120 fusions uh I I wanted to play by the way
00:18:24.640 I I wanted to play two of this because I
00:18:26.760 feel like DD Crow was a really relevant
00:18:28.120 card and I definitely did get rewarded
00:18:29.559 for that there were multiple people
00:18:30.840 throughout the tournament playing Crow
00:18:32.039 and that did DD Crow this so having a
00:18:34.120 second one was super important I would
00:18:35.600 not play less than
00:18:37.159 two now on the links I played Al marage
00:18:40.080 Al Mirage is only in here for the weird
00:18:41.600 hands where you just open the salamandra
00:18:43.760 level two you normal the salamander 2
00:18:45.720 Link off into Al marage and then search
00:18:47.400 salamander with chain and then
00:18:48.840 salamander with chain is live because Al
00:18:51.240 alaraj is a fire monster so um obviously
00:18:54.240 it's not a good board but it's at least
00:18:55.520 something if you draw a not so great
00:18:57.400 hand uh ferocious Flame Swordsman uh
00:18:59.919 this card's actually I threw it in there
00:19:01.880 because I was like well it's a Flame
00:19:02.880 Swordsman card I better play it but it
00:19:04.559 actually is really nice uh when it's uh
00:19:08.159 destroyed um you summon back ultimate
00:19:11.000 Flame Swordsman from the grave or
00:19:12.280 fighting flame Swordsmen um and which
00:19:15.400 you know gives you another search to be
00:19:16.679 able to play your next turn I actually
00:19:17.960 like this card a lot I thought it was
00:19:18.960 pretty good and then I played SP little
00:19:21.120 Knight um notably this is a warrior so
00:19:24.240 you can use flame swords Realms uh
00:19:26.720 attack modifying effect on this card you
00:19:29.760 know Target it lower it by a th000 then
00:19:31.400 have the rest of your board gain a th so
00:19:33.480 that did come up one time and
00:19:36.159 then sunlight wolf I played it's nice to
00:19:39.120 get Ash blossoms and fighting flame
00:19:40.400 swordsman's back into your hand uh
00:19:43.919 heita access code uh those are the links
00:19:47.360 I really did I summon this I think I
00:19:49.559 summoned this I can't remember if I ever
00:19:50.720 summon this but I did summon these I
00:19:53.480 don't think I ever summoned access code
00:19:55.559 um I did summon Barone I definitely
00:19:57.600 played this card
00:19:58.760 and then um
00:20:00.919 Typhon so Typhon is an amazing card
00:20:03.760 everybody knows that typhon's good but
00:20:05.640 Typhon has a really neat application in
00:20:07.320 this
00:20:08.159 deck and I'll I'll show that off right
00:20:11.080 now where you can if you are going
00:20:14.000 second you can have
00:20:17.120 this and have this all right so if you
00:20:20.400 are going second and you open both of
00:20:21.799 these it's pretty common happens a lot
00:20:23.919 you can activate flame swords realm into
00:20:25.520 a
00:20:26.280 board and then normal summon flame
00:20:28.480 Swordsmen activate its effect they can't
00:20:30.360 respond because you have flame swords
00:20:32.559 realm up right so you activate FL
00:20:34.520 fighting flame Swordsmen and add this
00:20:36.159 your hand so I'm going second why I'm
00:20:38.159 adding a trap well once that chain
00:20:40.159 resolves it's an open game State you go
00:20:42.919 you slap Typhon onto the board you
00:20:45.280 Typhon use this effect to out their
00:20:46.880 board and then you set this so you they
00:20:50.200 have to deal with the Typhon and you
00:20:51.600 have a non-targeting
00:20:53.159 book um to keep the Typhon on the board
00:20:56.600 right which also summons something from
00:20:58.919 the extra deck too so it makes your
00:21:00.360 board way stickier um and you get to you
00:21:03.760 know help protect that Typhon uh as you
00:21:06.280 are you know pushing through their board
00:21:07.559 we're going second so this card is like
00:21:09.720 phenomenal in this deck because you have
00:21:12.000 this so it it was I was super impressed
00:21:14.559 with Typhon I think I won like two games
00:21:17.600 because of tyon and there were a couple
00:21:19.279 times where I did the Typhon and with
00:21:20.919 the the flame swords stuff too so uh I I
00:21:24.159 love tyon in this deck and like I said
00:21:26.240 everybody knows typhon's good but it was
00:21:27.760 it was super cool to uh do that neat
00:21:30.279 little interaction and still like search
00:21:31.840 for an interruption and make tyon like
00:21:34.240 that was that was
00:21:36.240 phenomenal um okay so for the side deck
00:21:39.880 I
00:21:41.159 played three Crow Crow was fine I think
00:21:45.600 Crow is pretty okay moving into the next
00:21:48.320 format I think it's good against fire
00:21:50.200 king um I think it's pretty good against
00:21:52.679 Labyrinth because you know it hits the
00:21:54.039 furniture it hits the transaction roll
00:21:55.640 back Target um and it's good against
00:21:58.200 Unchained I played against Unchained um
00:22:00.919 at the event so this came up for sure
00:22:03.600 I'm not expecting Unchained to be like a
00:22:05.360 metad defining threat or anything but it
00:22:06.840 was it was there for reasons of you know
00:22:09.480 beating transaction roll back and and
00:22:11.400 whatever Crow was good against right it
00:22:12.760 was it's good against pearly too you
00:22:14.120 know so um it just felt like a card that
00:22:17.240 had a lot of um wide you know metad
00:22:20.840 defining impact or or not metad defining
00:22:23.559 sort of wide Decks that it's good
00:22:25.720 against right so uh this this felt fine
00:22:29.039 um I don't know if I would make it Bell
00:22:30.600 I might make it Bell but I'm so worried
00:22:32.880 about transaction roll back you know
00:22:34.039 what I mean so I'll probably keep it as
00:22:35.720 Crome just cuz I don't want to lose to
00:22:37.000 that one stupid card uh then I
00:22:40.640 played two copies of forbidden
00:22:44.159 droplet big mistake in deck building was
00:22:46.320 that this should have been at three I'll
00:22:48.640 show the one card combo off but the one
00:22:51.000 card combo searches twice it you you
00:22:53.840 search two times to get to Ultimate uh
00:22:56.120 Flame Swordsman on the board so so
00:22:58.480 droplet is extremely important for going
00:23:01.200 you know normal fighting Flame Swordsman
00:23:03.240 adding swords realm hold priority
00:23:06.640 activate droplet send a monster and some
00:23:09.240 other combination of cards negate their
00:23:11.320 board and that stops them from being
00:23:13.799 able to activate droll and then you do
00:23:16.559 the rest of the combo you search for the
00:23:18.200 salamander Fusion they'll drill you
00:23:20.159 there but it doesn't matter you've
00:23:21.520 already gotten the cards and rotation
00:23:23.320 that you need to summon ultimate Flame
00:23:25.400 Swordsman to be able to swing for big
00:23:27.640 damage and a lot of the times you're
00:23:28.919 doing that for game because you've used
00:23:30.200 droplet on monsters that they have so
00:23:32.919 this card should have been at three big
00:23:35.039 mistake of not playing that um I don't I
00:23:38.159 don't know if I lost games because I
00:23:40.039 didn't play three instead of two but I'm
00:23:43.080 definitely going to be playing three
00:23:44.400 instead of two uh moving forward that
00:23:46.720 was a big mistake in deck building is
00:23:48.159 only playing two of that and then three
00:23:51.960 Cosmic and a
00:23:54.279 harpies maybe I'll cut the duster I
00:23:56.799 don't know there's going to be a lot of
00:23:57.760 like like uh deck building changes when
00:23:59.799 it comes to this uh list but um duster
00:24:02.279 was fine I was worried about rescue a
00:24:03.600 and I did end up losing to rescue a
00:24:04.960 during the first round but it was so
00:24:07.360 stupid it was the first round my head
00:24:08.840 wasn't in the game you know son was in
00:24:10.600 my eyes little brother was playing my
00:24:12.039 deck whatever um we got to a super
00:24:14.760 simplified game ST in game one they
00:24:16.840 normal summon a hydrant with one card in
00:24:19.120 hand and I said dang if that one card in
00:24:21.640 hand is turbulence I get super punished
00:24:23.320 by this but I really want to pop that
00:24:25.000 drent so I use ultimate Flame Swordsman
00:24:26.960 to pop the drent and then they Ed the
00:24:28.720 reborn spell summon the hydrant and
00:24:30.039 search turbulence and I was like well I
00:24:32.159 don't know why I told myself this was
00:24:34.039 bad and I did it anyway but whatever uh
00:24:36.440 sometimes you just make bad plays I
00:24:38.559 guess so uh anyway Harpy's feather
00:24:41.159 duster is a card that I played and it
00:24:42.880 was like whatever it was there I don't
00:24:45.440 know this card feels like super
00:24:46.480 underwhelming I'm probably maybe this
00:24:47.799 will probably get cut for the third
00:24:48.840 droplet I feel like back removal sucks a
00:24:51.520 lot right now um so one salamander
00:24:54.760 retain and then two flame swords dancece
00:24:57.520 put these in here because these cards
00:24:59.159 like I said before are non once per turn
00:25:01.760 cards and Flames Swords Dance is much
00:25:04.039 better going first because it's only
00:25:05.880 live when a monster is special summoned
00:25:08.720 but um I don't know these AR not going
00:25:12.000 to get sided anymore I'm going to bump
00:25:13.919 Salam manager with chain to three in the
00:25:15.919 main deck and I'm going to either move
00:25:18.159 one or two of these to the main I want
00:25:19.760 as many of these as possible because
00:25:21.200 they get better when you have multiple
00:25:23.679 copies of them with each other like they
00:25:25.640 just make your board way better so
00:25:28.279 even though they're trap cards I feel
00:25:29.720 really confident about playing them in
00:25:31.640 the main deck just because they are
00:25:32.919 really good cards it's hard to explain
00:25:36.320 but the gameplay Loop of this deck as a
00:25:39.120 pure variant is like you really want to
00:25:42.600 see these cards as much as possible like
00:25:44.320 they work very well with each other and
00:25:46.080 very well with the archetype because
00:25:48.320 you're summoning stuff out of the extra
00:25:49.640 deck and you're flipping stuff face down
00:25:51.480 and then you're using this in the battle
00:25:52.799 phase tributing a monster summoning your
00:25:54.679 big guy it's just there's just a lot of
00:25:56.640 stuff that
00:25:58.240 the deck just gets better when you have
00:25:59.760 more of these in your
00:26:01.360 deck but I don't know so I'll probably
00:26:04.159 bump these both to three in the main
00:26:05.520 deck which sounds ridiculous cuz it's a
00:26:07.039 trap card but I don't know I'm still
00:26:08.640 very confident in that that I think I
00:26:10.000 would have performed even better if I
00:26:11.279 had more of these I don't know I'm
00:26:13.240 waffling out about but I decided to side
00:26:14.720 the rest because um I wanted to put them
00:26:17.279 in when I was going first but they
00:26:18.360 should have just been in my main and
00:26:20.039 then the last card of my side was a
00:26:21.679 non-negotiable this card like needs to
00:26:23.679 be played in the side deck when you're
00:26:25.000 going uh first because you lose so so
00:26:27.880 bad talents and thrust and duster and
00:26:29.559 lightning storb and all those kind of
00:26:30.640 cards so um I specifically cited this
00:26:33.640 always for going first and I'm going to
00:26:35.200 continue doing that because cards are
00:26:37.320 good it's an spell baby woohoo
00:26:39.960 floodgates yay
00:26:42.200 yipp um all right so let's talk about
00:26:46.520 combos what does this deck do why does
00:26:48.760 it do it this way why did I play Pure
00:26:50.360 all that kind of stuff first and
00:26:52.159 foremost this card you always want to be
00:26:53.919 opening this you want to start with this
00:26:55.440 you want to search this the way the
00:26:57.919 combo works is you normalist activate
00:26:59.880 effect add swords realm activate swords
00:27:02.720 realm use swords realm effect to Fusion
00:27:05.159 summon the OG Flame
00:27:08.880 Swordsman you do like
00:27:11.679 this that triggers the fighting flame
00:27:13.799 swords been effect in the grave to
00:27:16.679 dump which will be where are you oh
00:27:19.960 you're all the way at the top uh
00:27:21.640 salamander the flying flame dragon you
00:27:23.279 use this card's effect to search for a
00:27:24.799 salamander Spell trap which is going to
00:27:27.320 be this
00:27:29.640 you activate Sal diffusion targeting
00:27:31.480 Flame Swordsman use its effect to
00:27:35.200 fuse into the big
00:27:38.640 guy and then you use salamander's uh
00:27:41.480 graveyard effect to equip to Ultimate
00:27:44.519 Flame
00:27:45.279 Swordsman so this makes it a quick
00:27:47.679 effect D end that burns for five when it
00:27:49.080 pops a monster yes this is all with one
00:27:51.000 card um so the rest of the cards in your
00:27:53.760 hand could be non-engine or there could
00:27:55.399 be extra parts of the engine that allow
00:27:57.320 you to to search other layers of
00:27:58.600 interruption so for instance if I
00:28:03.240 have these two already what you can do
00:28:06.640 is you can normal this activate its
00:28:08.240 effect to search swords realm use the
00:28:10.279 effect to equip and then use swords
00:28:13.600 realm diffusion
00:28:16.039 summon you'll
00:28:17.960 go uh chain link one salamander chain
00:28:20.679 link two fighting Flame
00:28:22.960 Swordsman to send fighting flame dragon
00:28:26.000 instead of this because you already had
00:28:27.120 it
00:28:28.080 and then this will resolve to search the
00:28:31.600 fusion and then you'll fuse into the
00:28:35.360 ultimate and then you have fighting
00:28:37.200 flame dragon in rotation which you can
00:28:38.799 Equip to Ultimate flame Swordsmen and
00:28:41.039 the fighting flame dragon makes this a
00:28:42.279 double attacker so it's important to
00:28:44.399 play more copies of this because you do
00:28:46.360 want to open it alongside your one card
00:28:48.039 combo so you can get this card in
00:28:49.679 rotation quicker or that's not
00:28:51.960 necessarily an interruption but that's
00:28:53.880 just one way of how the deck benefits
00:28:56.200 when you have the redundant
00:28:57.960 engine and that's that's one way I like
00:29:00.679 to think about this deck is why it's
00:29:02.360 like pretty good is because not only is
00:29:05.120 the engine powerful and consistent it
00:29:06.960 can do one card combos and that kind of
00:29:08.559 stuff but it also is redundant right so
00:29:11.000 if I was to pretty common opening with
00:29:13.600 this deck is you have some combination
00:29:15.240 of these you know one of these could be
00:29:17.000 the quick play spell or anything like
00:29:18.640 that let's say you open these cards you
00:29:21.919 normal summon fighting Flame Swordsman
00:29:23.640 attempt to activate the effect to search
00:29:25.480 well they go hm right this is a normal
00:29:28.120 summon Searcher feels like a pretty good
00:29:29.679 thing to AFF failer or Talent or not
00:29:32.480 talents or imperm or Ash Blossom or
00:29:34.320 something like that so I go okay they
00:29:36.320 have used my handrop on this you know
00:29:37.799 theyve I've looped them for one I will
00:29:39.320 now activate swords realm and do the
00:29:41.039 rest of my combo right so because the
00:29:43.440 engine is redundant it prays on hands
00:29:47.600 that have a couple hand traps and you
00:29:49.480 can just play through them right or if
00:29:52.640 they don't have hand traps it also prays
00:29:56.440 on low interaction openings too because
00:29:59.039 you can get extra layers of interruption
00:30:01.600 so if you already have swords realm and
00:30:03.159 they don't have hand traps you normal
00:30:04.640 summon the fighting flame Swordsmen and
00:30:06.080 you don't need to search swords realm
00:30:07.440 because you already have it you can
00:30:09.159 search flame Swords Dance So you
00:30:12.679 activate the flame swords realm here do
00:30:14.440 the rest of your combo and then you end
00:30:16.000 by your turn by also setting flame
00:30:17.960 Swords Dance so it just it's this
00:30:21.039 interesting sort of phenomenon of your
00:30:25.080 hand is resilient to hand traps because
00:30:26.720 the engine is so redundant but it also
00:30:29.840 adds you extra layers of interruption if
00:30:31.880 your opponent is lacking interaction
00:30:33.720 right so um that's a really good thing
00:30:37.919 about the deck which I'm definitely
00:30:39.840 going to be building for because even if
00:30:41.480 you get hand trapped like I want extra
00:30:44.320 copies of these in the main deck because
00:30:46.760 getting hand trapped and having these to
00:30:50.480 end your end board on is just like so
00:30:52.840 strong like these cards are just so good
00:30:55.399 so I don't know I'm I'm super excited
00:30:57.320 I'm really happy with how the deck
00:30:58.519 performed um I am going to be playing it
00:31:01.639 more at some higher level events
00:31:03.799 throughout the
00:31:05.000 year and you know making
00:31:07.639 adjustments as necessary I'm I'm super
00:31:10.279 excited that they made this support I
00:31:12.320 think it's really cool it's uh it really
00:31:15.200 feels like a modernized old style of
00:31:19.279 Yu-Gi-Oh deck right and you know I've
00:31:20.919 been playing this game for a long time
00:31:22.240 so it just it's really cool to see that
00:31:24.279 the deck is good even though it's so
00:31:26.519 simple um with such a small engine like
00:31:29.080 it felt really strong so uh I'll be
00:31:31.039 making those adjustments that I talked
00:31:32.360 about planning at more events and I
00:31:34.000 can't I can't wait to uh talk about it
00:31:36.279 moving forward so thanks everybody for
00:31:37.679 watching I will see you next time
