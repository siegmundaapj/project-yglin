00:00:15.960 ahead and decide to go first 40 versus
00:00:17.560 41 opening hands we have fener pressured
00:00:20.160 Planet imperm theosis veiler they have
00:00:22.720 Noble arms Museum imperm wanted original
00:00:25.359 wanted okay so yeah still playing the
00:00:28.160 infer noal deck I feel like I haven't
00:00:29.720 seen Gio Franco play a different deck
00:00:31.519 besides infer Noy for the last like four
00:00:34.040 years uh but then we have Den match
00:00:36.200 design to play the castia strategy so
00:00:38.800 pressured Planet into unicorn and then
00:00:41.520 special summon out unicorn unicorn
00:00:43.440 effect they
00:00:44.719 imperm uh which I guess you know they
00:00:47.000 are on 40 cards so the odds of them
00:00:49.039 being on cash TI snake eye does go down
00:00:51.559 a little bit activate the osis go bring
00:00:54.399 out Fen reer and then activate Fen reer
00:00:57.000 effect go search grab out the cash TI
00:00:59.280 rise heart then cast you a rise heart
00:01:01.280 effect special summon out activate the
00:01:03.800 effect banish birth make him banish
00:01:05.438 three face down that hits a Warlords two
00:01:08.280 Ash Blossom okay and then overlay Mak
00:01:11.680 Shang and then set imperm pass they draw
00:01:14.799 terraforming standby phase Shane go
00:01:16.960 bring out unicorn and then main phase
00:01:19.840 activate wanted okay so we main phase
00:01:22.560 wanted instead of draw phase wanted then
00:01:24.840 discard wanted summon out black which
00:01:26.960 well I guess if you draw phase wanted
00:01:28.840 never mind no actually still works yeah
00:01:30.960 there's no point not to yeah yeah yeah
00:01:32.439 you should just do that then black witch
00:01:34.640 go ahead set wanted and then activate
00:01:37.000 terraforming to go search for Noble arms
00:01:39.200 Museum okay activate Museum pay 12 and
00:01:42.720 go search search out
00:01:45.000 Dall then activate durendal durendal go
00:01:47.920 search out the ogr sure normal summon
00:01:51.399 Oger effect to go dump dump the
00:01:55.439 Turin yeah and then anything on res nope
00:02:00.079 I'm confused on how exactly they are
00:02:02.280 going to break this board though they
00:02:06.399 bring out the Ricardo and then they
00:02:09.440 don't use its effect the special summon
00:02:11.360 back out from the graveyard okay uh then
00:02:14.120 we're going to make Angelica Angelica
00:02:16.560 effect go search grab out another Noble
00:02:18.879 arms Museum activate Museum pay 12 go
00:02:22.160 search grab out Al sure and then we're
00:02:25.160 going to go wanted banish put back
00:02:27.239 original draw on the moonlet chill not a
00:02:30.120 good draw for them uh but now I guess it
00:02:33.760 does show that they play a good amount
00:02:34.879 of hand traps though cuz like it's
00:02:37.120 probably like you know veiler imperm Ash
00:02:39.440 and then
00:02:40.959 moonlet uh so maybe they play like you
00:02:43.800 know at least 10 hand traps I'm guessing
00:02:46.560 activate Al and then they're going to go
00:02:48.480 tppon effect special summon itself out
00:02:51.840 okay looks like we're still not going to
00:02:53.480 do anything here we're just going to
00:02:54.680 hold on to our
00:02:56.080 interruptions uh so I'm going to have to
00:02:57.879 ask you to speed up please okay uh let's
00:03:01.440 see the turn started at 2 minutes and 40
00:03:04.640 seconds yeah it has been like 10 minutes
00:03:07.040 now they're going to make SP and then
00:03:08.959 now they're going to go SP on the fen
00:03:10.440 rear and then Al to special oh add back
00:03:13.319 Oger add back Oger okay okay okay okay
00:03:15.519 okay true true true true true yeah
00:03:18.360 usually alas was used on the gear fre
00:03:20.519 it's been a while since I've seen infer
00:03:22.080 or Inferno I almost called it infernoid
00:03:24.200 too activate recardio effect banish
00:03:27.000 special OG a okay uh said sec I actually
00:03:30.840 don't think you get to trigger Al here
00:03:32.599 since it was linked uh you definitely do
00:03:36.760 yeah to the gra wait this go the grave
00:03:39.439 because the equip monster sent to the
00:03:40.439 Grave they said yes yeah it is like a
00:03:44.120 pretty common thing but I guess we'll
00:03:45.680 just fast
00:03:46.799 forward oh they said okay just play on
00:03:49.400 out I'll play it later so I'm 100% sure
00:03:51.720 it's correct so don't worry yeah it is
00:03:54.400 100% correct that is how it works so
00:03:56.840 summon effect go down Magus and then
00:03:59.799 magest effect go put back and then draw
00:04:02.519 one so this will draw into a black which
00:04:06.599 holy we've drawn so many like of this
00:04:09.280 engine it's like the fourth card from
00:04:11.159 that engine we've drawn so far uh make
00:04:13.560 Promethean princess princess effects
00:04:15.760 went back out Angelica and then Turpin
00:04:19.040 effect uh Angelica effect dump I mean
00:04:23.759 obviously we're just trying to play
00:04:24.800 around Talons it's
00:04:27.639 like uh I don't know it's like okay it's
00:04:31.880 okay I guess uh make Captain Rolland and
00:04:35.680 then thinking here said nothing okay
00:04:38.039 battle phase beat over unicorn like now
00:04:40.520 that takes away like you know a rip from
00:04:42.520 the extra deck a Pop A Lock
00:04:45.600 Zone I don't know maybe Den match was
00:04:48.240 playing it too safe tpan effect to equip
00:04:52.280 Museum effect the special and then
00:04:54.560 Synchro off make Emperor Charles and
00:04:57.800 then Captain Rolland effect to equip
00:04:59.720 Charles effect to pop chain imperm on
00:05:01.759 the Charles sure then we're going to go
00:05:04.600 ahead and make Emperor Charles the great
00:05:06.639 effect to equip looks like they're
00:05:08.639 allowing that to go through and then
00:05:10.720 magius effect to equip Oliver effect to
00:05:13.080 equip activate Museum over Museum and
00:05:15.320 then Museum go ahead pay 12 go ahead
00:05:17.639 search out D Rendall and then affect the
00:05:19.960 museum push up Emperor Charles and then
00:05:22.280 we just pass
00:05:23.400 turn uh can't we end phase equip an
00:05:28.440 equip spell to this
00:05:30.639 uh yeah I mean we should be able to
00:05:31.880 right we didn't do that uh we don't even
00:05:34.240 have to like equip the monster we could
00:05:35.639 just equip just the equip spell yeah we
00:05:38.319 had the back row space for it so I don't
00:05:40.400 get why we didn't it uh they draw cat to
00:05:43.600 rise heart um then Shang effect they
00:05:46.199 said who are the equips on by the way
00:05:47.960 yeah they're all on the link one pretty
00:05:49.680 sure these only equipped to a
00:05:51.520 warrior um yeah Target a warrior Target
00:05:55.560 a warrior yeah and this is a fiend this
00:05:57.280 is a warrior and this wasn't on field
00:05:58.880 yet so we're going to bring out unicorn
00:06:01.400 and then Planet effect the pop said
00:06:04.680 Angelica comes back in end phase oh true
00:06:06.919 true true true true true
00:06:09.840 true yeah yep yep yep yep yep yep okay
00:06:13.000 bring that back out they said are you
00:06:15.199 still doing the same thing they said
00:06:16.800 yeah okay so they said that's before
00:06:20.599 Planet trigger a that's not true that's
00:06:23.039 not how it works but Planet chain link
00:06:24.960 one target Emperor Charles Moonlight
00:06:26.759 chain link 2 and then go ahead special
00:06:30.319 summon out but it is negated now switch
00:06:32.520 Shing to attack and then we're going to
00:06:34.560 go battle phase attacking the princess
00:06:36.880 we don't want to attack in the Angelica
00:06:38.199 H cuz then they'll get its effect so
00:06:40.160 Attack Just attach to protect and then
00:06:42.319 summon Zeus then activate Zeus effect to
00:06:45.160 go
00:06:46.080 wipe and then they're going to go ahead
00:06:48.800 chain Captain Roland chain Angelica
00:06:51.479 chain wanted so go search out black
00:06:53.800 which also imagine if Emperor Charles
00:06:55.319 equipped the equip spell you know right
00:06:56.680 there we would have got something for
00:06:58.319 free would have got something for free
00:07:00.240 there and then we're going to dump gear
00:07:03.039 free sure wipe the whole field and then
00:07:05.919 they get the effect to shuffle back and
00:07:08.160 draw which is just pretty good there
00:07:11.000 right just getting like free draws so
00:07:13.080 many free draws they've gotten now draw
00:07:15.000 Renard and like they're going to get
00:07:16.759 wanted free draw next turn two and draw
00:07:19.120 for turn normal summon rise heart AFF
00:07:21.720 banish theosis make them banish three
00:07:23.280 face down and they banished ber the
00:07:24.840 first time around uh they banish Poplar
00:07:27.800 there sure that's fine one for one
00:07:29.879 Heritage of the Chalice then theosis add
00:07:32.240 back birth okay activate birth birth
00:07:35.759 effect summon Out cast TI unicorn
00:07:38.120 unicorn effect go search out theosis and
00:07:41.120 then we're going to use Zeus plus rise
00:07:42.720 heart to make SP you know we're not XYZ
00:07:44.879 locked yet and then activate SP effect
00:07:47.520 go banish Turpin and then theosis to
00:07:50.080 special summon out fener and then fener
00:07:52.840 effect go search grab out scare claw
00:07:54.599 Casta and then probably just pass there
00:07:56.960 right um yeah just pass there they get
00:07:59.879 Angelica back draw into oh they play the
00:08:02.639 battlin boxer stuff okay draw in the
00:08:04.599 upper cutter and then now they're going
00:08:08.120 to go main phase uh the batt and boxer
00:08:12.360 stuff isn't nearly as good
00:08:14.680 now because they've already gone
00:08:18.039 through like
00:08:20.000 Dempsey uh but normal summon effect go
00:08:22.680 search barar and this stuff's also like
00:08:24.639 not the greatest going second cuz it
00:08:26.199 doesn't let you have a battle phase if
00:08:28.000 you special summon out this card
00:08:30.720 um so let's see if they even decide to
00:08:32.120 summon it yeah they're just going to
00:08:33.159 discard it summon black witch and then
00:08:35.039 black witch effect with said
00:08:37.120 original and
00:08:38.880 then okay special summon out renod renod
00:08:42.599 effect to add back gear
00:08:44.600 fre and then go ahead make another SP
00:08:49.640 and then SP effect go banish try to
00:08:51.800 banish
00:08:53.040 fener yeah I mean that's fine ogier
00:08:56.920 effect to equip and then oh Oliver
00:09:00.040 effect to equip sure gear freed effect
00:09:03.120 banish special summon out then if they
00:09:05.480 want to do anything there we have gear
00:09:07.399 freed effect that can try to stop them
00:09:08.880 so unicorn effect to rip they said okay
00:09:11.040 sure so rip appala which is like such a
00:09:14.360 weak rip there uh I don't know what's
00:09:17.040 UPS in their extra deck obviously but
00:09:19.200 not a great hit uh magius effect to
00:09:22.200 equip Sure original to send they said
00:09:25.600 it's been 50 minutes already please has
00:09:28.600 been close to 50 minutes but there's
00:09:30.560 also like a almost judge call at one
00:09:34.959 point uh uh okay yeah yeah yeah like
00:09:39.279 right
00:09:40.600 here yeah yeah it took like took like
00:09:43.200 seven minutes so I mean they did take a
00:09:44.959 long time when they could have just like
00:09:47.640 Googled the ruling and they would have
00:09:49.160 found it cuz like it a pretty common
00:09:52.560 interaction uh so now they're going to
00:09:54.200 go ahead bring out the Ricardo and then
00:09:55.760 ricardio chain link one magio chain link
00:09:58.240 2 birth chain link three they said wait
00:10:02.519 it's cost to put back they said okay
00:10:05.519 original Magus and Princess uh can't be
00:10:10.600 Magus targets you shuffled it yeah cuz
00:10:13.160 cost ricardio Target
00:10:15.360 then uh okay yeah so they're going to go
00:10:19.600 ahead banish and then they draw into mum
00:10:24.440 and then activate Museum and then we're
00:10:27.880 going to go Captain Rolland effect to
00:10:29.560 equip sure chain well actually they're
00:10:31.720 going to chain SP to banish itself plus
00:10:33.399 unicorn there
00:10:37.120 uh yeah that's okay I mean if they let
00:10:41.200 it go through they said you have to play
00:10:43.519 faster is getting out of hand now one
00:10:45.120 hour for game one said please don't
00:10:47.240 ignore the judge call you did but yeah
00:10:49.560 okay so they're going to go ahead and
00:10:50.639 gear free negate which I think is fair
00:10:52.680 to do there I feel like they should also
00:10:54.480 do that and then in response the veiler
00:10:56.200 we should chain our SP to banish of
00:10:59.480 their field uh wait you can't send it I
00:11:02.000 chained it oh yeah they can send Oliver
00:11:05.839 oh true wait yeah yeah yeah they have to
00:11:09.560 send Oliver I was going to say because
00:11:10.560 they can't veiler this beforehand wait
00:11:13.839 yeah they wouldn't be able to veiler
00:11:15.000 that otherwise okay veiler okay gear
00:11:18.480 freed or Captain Rolland chain link one
00:11:21.120 SP chain link 2 gear freed chain link
00:11:23.360 three veiler chain link four SP chain
00:11:25.639 link five to banish SP plus gear freed
00:11:29.120 uh
00:11:30.040 uh sure oh I guess that makes more sense
00:11:34.040 than what I was saying before that
00:11:35.440 definitely makes more sense Museum go
00:11:37.760 ahead and search yep cuz I was thinking
00:11:40.519 that they were going to SP banish one of
00:11:41.720 the opponent's monsters and beat over
00:11:43.399 and leave SP on their field so that way
00:11:45.920 they can't like summon out a cash Tia
00:11:48.000 but I think it's actually better just to
00:11:49.880 like fully wipe out what they have
00:11:51.720 because they can just normal summon off
00:11:53.120 birth unless if we can also out
00:11:56.120 birth uh which we might actually be able
00:11:58.120 to do
00:11:59.839 uh so now they're thinking they said end
00:12:02.920 the turn stop viewing 20 minutes already
00:12:05.040 for your turn let's go bro don't keep me
00:12:07.839 hostage it's actually crazy CU I know
00:12:09.320 Den match is getting mad cuz the
00:12:10.680 opponent's slow playing but I feel like
00:12:12.760 if Den match just didn't play around
00:12:14.880 Talons like as much as he did he would
00:12:17.600 have won this game like for sure like
00:12:20.160 100% they could have ripped the extra
00:12:22.240 deck twice by now instead of just
00:12:24.240 ripping it once cuz I mean they ripped
00:12:26.040 Appo but like that's not a real rip they
00:12:27.720 could have ripped earlier in the turn
00:12:29.720 so they could have ripped from the extra
00:12:31.360 twice they could have got fenri banished
00:12:33.480 twice they could have got Shang in the
00:12:35.560 planet pop ones there a lot of
00:12:37.880 interruptions that they lost because of
00:12:40.480 how they played it um now they're going
00:12:42.440 to go ahead yeah the link off in the
00:12:44.399 then alason Dall so now they're going to
00:12:47.360 go ahead said bro if you don't play
00:12:48.800 faster I'll send this replay to the
00:12:50.199 judges to handle the issue when they can
00:12:52.839 okay so bring out Angelica and then go
00:12:55.560 ahead and add back the captain Roland
00:12:59.320 and then Angelica effect go ahead search
00:13:02.839 out Museum he effect go take cash rise
00:13:06.639 heart battle phase uh we will crash with
00:13:10.000 the castia Unicorn end the main scare

00:13:22.720 works okay there so banish special

00:14:47.800 it cannot be destroyed by battle but I
00:14:50.320 feel like this game is going to end
00:14:51.440 pretty quickly here so they're going to
00:14:52.759 try to SP effect the ogre oh oh wait no

00:16:02.560 Blossom we have a free original send to
00:16:05.240 go bring out the Ricardo recardo effect
00:16:08.279 Den match should just submit defeat if
00:16:09.880 they really want to save time because
00:16:11.240 this game's obviously over Nick Angelica
00:16:14.600 Angelica magius go ahead put back and
00:16:18.319 then draw oh no they just put back the
00:16:20.839 dendle so now the replay is actually
00:16:22.720 just broken okay well he hey it works

00:16:28.279 search out music Museum then activate
00:16:31.079 tows to go take grab out unicorn and
00:16:33.959 then cool attack for game so now moving
00:16:36.319 on to game three said was it better now
00:16:38.160 my speed I mean they said yes it was I
00:16:41.360 mean weird when you play against you
00:16:42.800 know zero interruptions it becomes a lot
00:16:44.800 easier to play but we got unicorn
00:16:46.560 pressured Planet fener Ash Blossom casir
00:16:49.040 rise heart they have Ash Blossom Roto
00:16:51.120 moonl Chell black witch moonl Chell so
00:16:53.800 we're going to go special summon out
00:16:55.279 unicorn moonlit chill that on summon
00:16:58.079 normal rise effect banish fener uh they
00:17:01.519 banish veiler Talent wanted face down
00:17:04.919 then overlay make Draco sack Draco sack
00:17:08.439 effect can't moonlit twice in one turn
00:17:11.720 yeah they realized every as they did it
00:17:13.959 uh so go ahead bring out tokens and then
00:17:16.720 link off okay so link spider link spider
00:17:19.959 G Golem G Golem effect special summon
00:17:22.760 back out
00:17:24.439 okay and then link those off into heat
00:17:27.559 Soul uh activate pressured Planet which
00:17:32.000 they should be ashing this because it's
00:17:34.120 guaranteed trading with an interruption
00:17:36.679 because it's an extender here which
00:17:39.240 means that's going to allow them to make
00:17:40.799 IP and if they have birth in hand which
00:17:43.200 could be seen as the other
00:17:44.840 extender uh if birth is used to make IP
00:17:48.799 that's fine because then they don't have
00:17:51.080 like Fen rear plus birth effect alive so
00:17:53.799 that means they'll probably just leave
00:17:54.760 Draco sack there yes I feel like they
00:17:57.000 should have Ash that they're going to
00:17:58.039 search GE CL cash then heat so draw
00:18:01.240 another Ash Blossom scare claw cash Tia
00:18:03.520 special summon by banishing and then
00:18:05.880 link off to make IP pass they draw
00:18:10.400 effect veiler heat SL to draw they Ash
00:18:12.559 Blossom it see see see we could have
00:18:14.400 guaranteed traded with an interruption
00:18:16.400 instead of risking if we trade with an
00:18:18.480 interruption then activate Roa go ahead
00:18:21.360 search out
00:18:22.440 ogier then now we're going to go normal
00:18:25.720 OG yeah OG effect dump all of
00:18:29.480 and then Oliver effect to equip IP
00:18:32.760 effect go ahead link off into SP when
00:18:36.600 shouldn't we have done this like before
00:18:39.400 they Oliver effect to
00:18:41.760 equip so we're going to go SP banish
00:18:45.919 Oliver then moonlet the
00:18:49.559 SP yeah wait wait moonlet would have had
00:18:53.120 to been chain link one yeah okay yeah
00:18:55.120 Moonlight chain link one SP chain link 2
00:18:58.280 Target Oliver okay that's fine so we
00:19:01.559 just want to shut off the second effect
00:19:03.080 of it which I guess makes sense cuz
00:19:04.280 we're about to lose our Oliver I mean we
00:19:06.520 know that's going to get banished cuz
00:19:07.600 they can't banish this nothing good to
00:19:08.960 banish from the graveyard okay discard
00:19:10.520 veiler summon out black witch and then
00:19:13.080 activate the black witch effect set
00:19:15.559 original okay then go up into
00:19:18.720 he hea effect take heat Soul heat Soul
00:19:22.120 effect pay a, to draw draw on the
00:19:24.159 Forbidden droplet and then link those
00:19:26.919 off to make Promethean Prince
00:19:28.750 [Music]
00:19:30.400 yeah would have been real cool if we
00:19:32.679 just access coding one there but this is
00:19:35.159 still fine Promethean princess effect
00:19:37.320 special back out from the graveyard H
00:19:40.320 original Sun princess the ash Blossom
00:19:42.880 battle phase beat
00:19:44.600 over uh I mean is at
00:19:48.559 18 so uh sure it's under moonlet too so
00:19:52.799 hopefully they remember that damage yep
00:19:55.640 and then set droplet pass draw imperm so
00:19:59.159 we're just going to go set pass cuz if
00:20:01.120 we special fener we're going to get hit
00:20:02.840 with Promethean princess which also
00:20:04.480 gives our opponent more followup so set
00:20:07.280 imper pass they draw wanted activate
00:20:10.039 wanted go ahead search out black witch
00:20:13.039 and then yep they just go ahead and Adit
00:20:14.720 defeat there uh it's not a guaranteed
00:20:17.799 game though right cuz original you as
00:20:21.400 they wanted they
00:20:22.919 draw they summon black witch they set
00:20:25.559 followup they go battle phase attack Oh
00:20:29.039 wait we're at
00:20:30.880 4350 and that happens to be 4350 damage
00:20:35.200 oh that's awkward yeah that's
00:20:38.640 unfortunate uh seeing how long the match
00:20:41.600 was is about 85 minutes
00:20:44.039 long
00:20:45.679 holy holy uh all right all right all
00:20:49.280 right with all that being said the DB
