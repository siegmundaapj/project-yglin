00:01:48.520 with Josh by the
00:01:50.119 way I'm making great first impressions
00:01:53.600 yes uh stand by main okay what if what
00:01:58.000 if I play Lusk uh the the the thingy
00:02:01.360 what if I'm
00:02:02.640 ready what if I have Armory arm in my
00:02:05.479 extra
00:02:06.360 deck wait is that how they do that yeah
00:02:09.758 that's the way you can beat
00:02:11.400 it and what do they
00:02:14.400 do um you go if they have any other
00:02:17.200 monster on their field you Armory arm
00:02:18.680 equipped to their monster and then uh
00:02:21.360 the level 10 Synchro switches it to
00:02:23.040 attack and then you just crash all your
00:02:24.879 monsters into the monster with Armory
00:02:28.239 arm how you make arm well that's its own
00:02:31.519 uh that's its own Journey well it's a
00:02:33.400 tuner and a
00:02:34.599 non-tuner well it's a level four
00:02:38.959 so I showed you my ass please respond I
00:02:42.319 have no response no no
00:02:47.480 no normally that is what people
00:02:51.680 do uh I'm playing against a a World
00:02:55.000 Champ I don't think I have any responses
00:02:58.000 uh I have to I have to let him combo and
00:03:00.959 dude my deck is not ready for this it's
00:03:04.280 not it's not prepared oh
00:03:09.120 god oh I think everyone gets kind of
00:03:13.000 witness that like you guys want a going
00:03:16.159 second deck but you don't want this
00:03:18.799 going second deck I'll say
00:03:21.400 that it's not it's not nine R GIS but
00:03:25.120 it's it's about as reasonably close to
00:03:28.560 nine R GIS as you
00:03:30.720 Ash send
00:03:32.400 Oak that is
00:03:42.000 fine you know Josh you said you wanted
00:03:44.120 some quick games well this will be some
00:03:46.120 quick G well yeah maybe that's actually
00:03:47.840 the the the solution to my
00:03:51.400 problem this might just be the solution
00:03:53.640 to my
00:03:55.680 problem uh I'll place this
00:03:58.400 back it's it's it's super annoying cuz I
00:04:01.000 also I don't play two flamber so I have
00:04:02.640 to do this in a very weird way because
00:04:05.439 okay cuz normally you scale the other
00:04:07.840 flamb bur but yeah yeah I was expecting
00:04:11.599 like I'm not used to seeing this it's
00:04:13.959 just going to be like a a r instead of
00:04:16.358 like Appaloosa CL version IP it's just
00:04:19.160 going to be you know it is literally
00:04:21.839 just the
00:04:23.960 minimum uh
00:04:28.520 yeah well don't worry when I go first I
00:04:30.960 have all types of war crimes deide in
00:04:36.440 so thanks so this is just a Tempi dragon
00:04:38.919 mirror at the end of the day right and
00:04:41.360 then I'm going to use my extender that
00:04:44.280 doesn't extend anything cuz I don't play
00:04:46.000 anything for it you don't play you don't
00:04:48.520 play any jet synchrons or anything like
00:04:50.560 that so you're just going to you can't
00:04:52.199 even get a draw I mean you can draw one
00:04:54.320 that's what I'm doing it's it's upstar
00:04:57.080 Goblin um
00:04:59.840 what do I send for it though probably

00:05:06.280 have a minus one so then I will
00:05:11.639 set it feels bad using original here
00:05:17.039 but guess that is what I do
00:05:21.080 original do I send for
00:05:24.840 it I could subversion my own diab Bel
00:05:27.479 star
00:05:33.800 I mean I think that's it I want to keep
00:05:35.919 it around I'll subversion my own diab
00:05:37.520 start draw a
00:05:38.919 card

00:13:36.480 big enough
00:13:40.199 yes and
00:13:42.560 then uh I guess I'll go Hydra to Synchro
00:13:54.120 mhm we'll go for Biden
00:13:57.160 dragon and then uh
00:13:59.839 B and dragon effect Target the back

00:14:11.360 negated by droplet but it doesn't matter
00:14:12.880 right you can just use the other one I
00:14:14.639 mean yeah I could have just use the
00:14:15.480 other one I keep forgetting this is

00:14:18.040 one also has quick effect Synchro right
00:14:19.800 yes yes I just go quick effect Synchro
00:14:21.399 it's very funny how this deck can play
00:14:23.399 around like surus CU you just go chain
00:14:26.000 link one to Synchro chain link 2 to
00:14:27.199 Synchro and you just Synchro as chain
00:14:28.519 link 2 every single time okay uh so
00:14:31.480 there are some fun things you can do
00:14:32.759 with this fun still can't attack over
00:14:34.720 the princess
00:14:36.639 though so is the which one is the the
00:14:39.240 green one is can't be destroyed by
00:14:40.560 battle or you don't take
00:14:42.680 damage uh this is I can't be destroyed
00:14:45.079 by battle so yeah I actually could just
00:14:46.600 I could just swing into it and take a
00:14:47.920 100 but I've already attacked three
00:14:49.880 times so that's the magic number here I
00:14:52.900 [Music]
00:14:56.560 do I'm actually running out of body but
00:14:59.720 I think I
00:15:02.160 still what do I do
00:15:08.880 here
00:15:11.560 um that's actually funny I should have
00:15:13.560 summoned back another three instead of
00:15:16.399 the
00:15:18.000 Fortuner uh but we'll
00:15:19.630 [Music]
00:15:21.360 go badra effect
00:15:24.199 mhm what if I Synchro Summon my wallet
00:15:26.759 right now but
00:15:30.440 I'm not that's not going to not going to
00:15:33.759 happen I
00:15:37.600 do wow is the 10p dragon deck actually
00:15:40.120 going to miss lethal here you said so
00:15:43.079 confidently that I was going to die I
00:15:44.959 should you literally if you do not win
00:15:47.240 this turn it's you you have to stop
00:15:49.440 playing this game it's so embarrassing
00:15:50.880 if you don't kill
00:15:52.480 me you said you are so
00:15:56.160 dead I'm going to make a feature Match
00:15:58.240 review if you don't get me on
00:16:01.839 that oh
00:16:06.079 man well if I Synchro Summon my wallet I
00:16:08.560 think I have game well my mouse has died
00:16:11.240 so figure it out while I'm finding
00:16:13.720 summon uh my printer Air tempai Dragon

00:16:27.519 sure two plus dude did you ask a friend
00:16:29.839 for that or or what uh yeah so this is I
00:16:33.839 asked a friend and he gave me a slice of
00:16:35.880 a printer paper he's like yeah I got you
00:16:37.720 bro not a great friend is it might want
00:16:40.759 to think that friendship boo I go bite
00:16:43.639 it Dragon sumon itself from graveyard uh
00:16:45.839 I'll pop your
00:16:47.000 set and then well that's a
00:16:49.399 one yeah yeah uh and I'll swing over the
00:16:54.240 princessing
00:16:55.959 Phoenix no yeah yeah I scop you got
00:17:00.440 it impressive stuff impressive stuff the
00:17:04.599 game did end on that turn though it did
00:17:07.119 end I'm playing against a world
00:17:09.000 championship in front of 2,000 people
00:17:10.919 and they just watched me mess up a 10pi
00:17:13.079 dragon otk it is I mean in your defense
00:17:15.720 it's not very linear is it w i mean it
00:17:17.760 should be pretty
00:17:18.959 linear yeah that was ironic I feel like
00:17:21.760 if you just save your quick plays for
00:17:23.520 the battle phase see that's what I
00:17:24.919 wasn't sure about I'm always nervous
00:17:26.640 that they like I don't know make the
00:17:27.799 level 10 before entering battle phase or
00:17:29.480 something but then I can probably just
00:17:30.600 take that but yeah it's probably right I
00:17:32.320 mean this is the first time I've played
00:17:33.559 against it not hard hard opening the
00:17:35.200 field spell is kind of cringe of you
00:17:37.559 sorry since I didn't anticipate this to
00:17:39.480 be post Legacy of Destruction at all I
00:17:41.880 don't have anything in my side deck for
00:17:43.480 tenpai Dragons I'm thinking i s in Bisal
00:17:46.880 maybe because they can mess with the otk
00:17:49.080 I mean it's better than if I have like a
00:17:51.559 subversion in my deck aren't they all
00:17:53.360 fires yeah but I can banish my own stuff
00:17:55.240 just to put some blockers basically
00:17:57.240 maybe before the level 10 hits the I
00:17:59.159 just put like bald Drake up and then Bal
00:18:01.000 Drake can maybe even negate a special
00:18:03.080 summon in the battle phase or something
00:18:04.559 like that blockers are useless yeah but
00:18:06.200 like what do you want me to do keep in
00:18:07.440 thrust going first like I don't know
00:18:08.960 what to tell you I don't have anything
00:18:10.559 for this matchup it's not out yet when I
00:18:12.360 built this deck for I feel like these
00:18:14.080 just always have to go these four the
00:18:16.320 talons might actually work cuz there
00:18:17.640 might be hand traps but since I don't
00:18:18.960 have a trap for the thrust I just need
00:18:20.799 to site that out right and then like I
00:18:22.600 guess I'll take out this right five for
00:18:25.600 five everything else here is useless for
00:18:27.799 this match up so I'll I'll do that all
00:18:29.440 right I'm ready and uh Giga prepared for
00:18:31.760 this match up with my side deck is what
00:18:33.600 I just noticed okay dude you have my
00:18:35.840 entire chat questioning the viability of
00:18:37.880 10p dragons right now so I totally
00:18:40.280 didn't forget to trigger the red dragon
00:18:42.960 effect it summons from deck no yeah yeah
00:18:46.159 I I tunnel it a little too much there
00:18:49.440 and okay so I was probably dead right uh
00:18:51.880 yes you yeah definitely CU I would make
00:18:54.120 two Synchro 10 instead of just the one
00:18:55.720 Synchro 10 and if I summon the tempai
00:18:58.600 one you can't raging Phoenix anything
00:19:00.360 back yeah yeah I felt like something was
00:19:02.360 wrong and it definitely was and now my
00:19:04.679 friends are telling me to stop
00:19:05.679 misplaying and it's good advice honestly
00:19:09.200 solid all right do I begin
00:19:12.280 again uh yes or am I going to get like
00:19:14.799 Heatwave okay I'll go first no
00:19:18.840 no see it's such a
00:19:21.760 good going second yeah no it's it's a
00:19:25.240 good hand in general if it wasn't like
00:19:27.600 for that specific match
00:19:30.400 up um okay let me check my extra deeg
00:19:33.360 and see if I have anything that's
00:19:34.559 particularly good against this deck
00:19:37.200 definitely want
00:19:39.000 this I mean that's it though I just do
00:19:41.600 the normal stuff okay
00:19:44.400 well
00:19:47.440 um we can I'll start us
00:19:52.400 off with a wanted in the draw phase
00:19:57.039 gotcha
00:20:01.080 grab a d Bell
00:20:07.120 star I I'm just playing this cuz I'm I
00:20:09.679 I'm assuming you have no hand traps
00:20:11.120 maybe I should have ordered this
00:20:12.240 differently but it's fine looking at my
00:20:15.320 hand it doesn't look like a lot of hand
00:20:17.760 traps I mean based on what you just saw
00:20:20.080 I don't think my list would play any
00:20:21.440 many hand traps anyways uh Ash effect
00:20:27.039 yeah pop effect
00:20:32.600 and grab
00:20:42.880 original
00:20:48.240 Temple that'ss
00:20:56.159 oh Ash sends all summons
00:21:16.600 flamers
00:21:22.260 [Music]
00:21:24.679 um IP chaining one flers chaining two
00:21:28.080 pop
00:21:29.630 [Music]
00:21:31.840 uh this time I'm going to scale
00:21:34.520 it this this hope this
00:21:43.880 yep I'm just calling you play no hand
00:21:46.200 traps right now it's a little risky
00:21:50.760 but uh oh
00:21:55.760 actually send the FL
00:22:04.799 yeah my strategy versus branded is to
00:22:06.880 hope that they don't know the right line
00:22:08.240 to play around
00:22:11.159 droplet
00:22:21.400 [Music]
00:22:24.840 okay uh promethian

00:23:44.559 the field spell it's whatever sacrifice
00:23:46.480 everything for

00:24:30.080 I'm doing uh I grab Hornet drones and
00:24:33.799 draw one grab Hornet drones that's
00:24:36.080 terrifying yeah listen
00:24:42.679 listen I have establish that monster
00:24:45.440 interruptions are not useful against
00:24:46.960 your deck so I'm going to Hornet drones

00:25:26.360 engage or Widow anchor
00:25:35.279 one weirdly enough this isn't yeah this
00:25:38.279 is not that terrible I've never seen a
00:25:41.039 format Appaloosa and go probably there's
00:25:45.080 probably a way to actually make this to
00:25:47.960 where I can draw a bunch of cards and
00:25:49.559 it's worth
00:25:51.080 it
00:25:52.600 but this probably wasn't it but it's
00:25:55.080 okay I'll set two
00:25:59.000 pass so I just know you had to Anchor
00:26:03.240 basically drones and two and two draws

00:28:58.760 [Music]
00:29:08.600 yeah I realize yeah there's definitely a
00:29:10.679 different play but it's a little
00:29:12.880 counterintuitive the draa makes life
00:29:14.760 really
00:29:16.919 annoying um
00:29:32.120 this could get interesting we can
00:29:33.159 actually play a Grind game out of this
00:29:34.720 uh I'll proceed a battle
00:29:37.200 phase

00:29:46.919 and actually yeah I do have to go and
00:29:51.679 then I'll quick play here mhm

00:30:45.159 zongora uh the yeah zongora chundra TCG
00:30:48.840 name but uh this one is not a tuna right
00:30:52.120 so you can't quick Synchro right now
00:30:54.240 that is correct
00:31:10.000 I'll try to Anchor
00:31:14.519 it
00:31:19.480 see and then
00:31:40.720 yeah uh I'll droplet send
00:31:42.830 [Music]
00:31:45.200 the

00:31:56.600 now uh
00:31:59.440 to be
00:32:02.000 decided at the
00:32:06.840 be yeah I'll at that 800 this is at
00:32:10.200 1,200 yeah I'll go black rose
00:32:12.720 Dragon uh attack over uh and then in
00:32:15.600 damage St alra summon from De the pyra
00:32:19.000 and then pyra to search for
00:32:22.240 f uh do I want to set the field
00:32:25.200 spell yeah let me read this quick just
00:32:28.880 doesn't have to be face
00:32:30.880 up it
00:32:35.900 [Music]
00:32:37.519 okay and then uh hit for
00:32:41.559 15 and then attack for 17 so that's 1936
00:32:46.679 total I yeah that's already game no
00:32:48.799 level seven already games
00:32:50.399 me uh yeah level level seven summons
00:32:54.799 back I mean I can play the whole line
00:32:56.679 out but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Su summ
00:32:58.639 back sum a three yeah yeah yeah no I I
00:33:02.760 the thing is I started playing my turn
00:33:04.440 without knowing exactly what I wanted
00:33:05.960 from it I feel like the spell and traps
00:33:08.159 or like the quick play spells are
00:33:09.279 actually better disruption than the
00:33:10.480 monster stuff believe it or not yes I
00:33:12.440 had a super poly in the hands so all the
00:33:14.240 monster interruptions that you put up
00:33:15.559 just that's what I thought but there's
00:33:17.279 probably still a way to do that more
00:33:18.919 optimally than what I did I kind of just
00:33:20.760 started doing the the standard stuff and
00:33:22.320 then I realized halfway through the
00:33:23.720 standard stuff actually doesn't cut it
00:33:25.279 but okay all right time to side in the
00:33:27.120 war Crim I'm going to let him go first
00:33:29.679 but I don't know if I really change
00:33:31.360 anything about the deck what could
00:33:32.760 happen if I get flood gated what do I do
00:33:35.440 I canci an After Burner in case The
00:33:37.080 Floodgate is a trap card that I like
00:33:39.000 that idea I don't think I'm going to
00:33:40.240 need kurri Cara what if magical spring
00:33:42.399 is just insane because they can't pop
00:33:44.440 their field spell after you activate it
00:33:46.399 you ever think about that it says spell
00:33:48.399 and trap cards your opponent controls
00:33:49.840 can't be destroyed by battle or card
00:33:51.320 Effect you still get game though I mean
00:33:53.760 listen it's better than nothing what do
00:33:55.799 I take out monster Reborn talents and
00:33:58.720 aysal I have discovered technology oh
00:34:01.559 okay that is just not have it on the
00:34:03.639 table oh or you're talking out you're
00:34:05.960 talking about siding you should probably
00:34:07.440 have Lusk an extra side for next time
00:34:09.280 yeah it's because F broke the rules I
00:34:11.040 said no Legacy of Destruction yet and
00:34:12.879 here we are tell me I couldn't literally
00:34:15.440 bug
00:34:16.440 abusing I have a plan for Le Lusk if you
00:34:19.480 did play it unironically if I was
00:34:21.399 playing a going first deck I don't think
00:34:23.159 I would let tenpai go first game three
00:34:25.440 if I'm expecting him to side that much
00:34:26.879 stuff in I'll just do my combo and their
00:34:28.560 hand traps or board Breakers are just
00:34:30.199 all the blood Gates that's why I think
00:34:32.639 Heatwave is not that good if they make
00:34:34.879 you go second that is a brick in your
00:34:36.760 hand yeah I assume I'm starting yeah
00:34:40.639 okay
00:34:45.119 ghf best luck all right let's see what
00:34:48.199 we
00:34:53.560 got great hand
00:35:01.839 standby and the main
00:35:04.119 phase um I'll activate field spell
00:35:07.960 mhm good thing I didn't go first dude I
00:35:10.160 have no out to that
00:35:14.640 yeah uh yeah we'll go ahead
00:35:17.880 [Music]
00:35:32.320 yeah I don't even think it's worth going
00:35:33.800 for that
00:35:39.040 line I add
00:35:44.280 this I think okay no no no I have the I
00:35:47.920 have the play uh I'll add
00:35:51.720 pyra yep and
00:35:55.400 then I'll discard it
00:36:00.160 nice and then I'll normal summon fodra
00:36:02.720 fodra tar to pyra
00:36:05.640 yeah then pyro effect
00:36:12.720 search oh add the quick play
00:36:16.599 y ogre can hit the field spell yeah ogre
00:36:19.200 is really good against the field spell
00:36:22.119 yes yeah
00:36:24.760 ogres mostly only versus actually
00:36:27.720 weirdly enough if I don't have field
00:36:29.440 spell ogre on the pyra is also just just
00:36:32.680 taking the fire dragon off the field is
00:36:34.400 also just very annoying although there's
00:36:35.920 probably a world where people just don't
00:36:37.400 use the search effect if they already
00:36:38.839 have combo right just to play around it
00:36:41.160 yes yes that's that that happens very
00:36:43.359 often when you already have like two
00:36:44.480 card combo you never able to use this
00:36:45.960 effect a search it's
00:36:47.520 also that's why we need Vos
00:36:53.920 dude um I'll make an awesome end board
00:36:58.640 and hopefully I don't get lightning
00:36:59.680 storm because I'm going to Pros here for
00:37:02.400 a very some very fun cards you're going
00:37:04.640 to love
00:37:09.280 them this goes this
00:37:12.079 goes this goes this
00:37:18.920 goes one of these this goes Prosper six
00:37:22.800 yep
00:37:27.640 oh a lot of fun cards okay okay okay
00:37:32.680 that was very mid that is
00:37:37.560 manageable got to love to see
00:37:47.900 [Music]
00:37:56.200 that there there's no way this is
00:37:58.200 correct cuz I just know it's not good
00:37:59.480 against your deck but it was better than
00:38:00.839 all the other cards I
00:38:02.359 had so dude no what are you
00:38:05.440 doing I'm adding a I'm adding a just a
00:38:08.040 meaningless terraform I don't yeah yeah
00:38:09.760 but like I'm what do you mean by that
00:38:12.960 yeah yeah what do you mean by that
00:38:14.160 that's
00:38:16.000 fine what was that necro
00:38:19.560 Valley or what oh
00:38:26.090 [Music]
00:38:28.560 I didn't want to afd cuz I'm like that's
00:38:31.560 terrible but you know if my prop is only
00:38:33.400 going to give me a Floodgate I I guess
00:38:35.040 I'll take this Floodgate
00:38:38.560 M
00:38:40.119 think is that one yep
00:38:45.920 ass isn't this like riveting gameplay
00:38:48.359 chat look at
00:38:50.400 this
00:38:52.760 uh
00:38:55.079 okay so I
00:38:58.240 all draw phase
00:39:03.280 wanted no
00:39:09.880 response I will move to the main
00:39:13.520 phase
00:39:17.359 yep uh I'm going to
00:39:19.880 pitch another wanted or a diabel star
00:39:24.119 and use the effect
00:39:31.040 um the effects
00:39:34.760 fine it will
00:39:42.960 set
00:39:46.520 original on resolution I'm going to make
00:39:49.079 a lot of friends by activating rivalry
00:39:51.960 of the Warlords
00:39:57.599 that's
00:39:58.720 dope yeah isn't this fun I love that for
00:40:02.280 me don't you like diversity of the

00:45:01.200 yeah I'm just looking for the third

00:45:05.599 D yeah I should have just done on that
00:45:09.559 Hydra and just summon fun and
00:45:12.359 interactive
00:45:13.920 Dragon uh effect switch your monsters to
00:45:16.720 attack it's so fun and interactive it
00:45:18.920 stops my opponents from activating
00:45:20.200 effects during the battle
00:45:24.760 phase yeah I mean that's more than
00:45:26.680 enough right yeah you just like this
00:45:29.200 comes back and makes Tri and dragon yeah
00:45:32.160 yeah you could make trid and dragon but
00:45:33.880 you don't even have to at this point
00:45:35.599 yeah no the reason chat the reason why I
00:45:37.760 didn't start with engage was because I
00:45:39.119 wanted three spells and starting with
00:45:40.839 engage also doesn't beat rivalry cuz I
00:45:42.599 have After Burner in theory but uh I
00:45:45.000 couldn't get the diab eler off the field
00:45:46.559 so it is what it is well nice showcase
00:45:49.280 nice Showcase of Tempi dragons is this
00:45:51.920 the going second deck you guys wanted uh
00:45:54.200 I mean I'm going to be honest if I had
00:45:55.680 cards in my site deck for it
00:45:57.720 I I hard lose to a lightning storm there
00:46:00.040 so I mean I have seals and Ash Bloss in
00:46:02.480 my hand to try and stop a a striker
00:46:04.720 snake ey otk the technology I was
00:46:07.280 talking about is magical spring stopping
00:46:09.000 you from popping the field spell it's
00:46:11.160 still probably game most of the time but
00:46:13.359 that does work I was testing that card
00:46:15.160 for ycs Vegas believe it or not right
00:46:17.839 now it's really insane versus voiceless
00:46:20.200 voice because they're putting up three
00:46:22.800 continuous spells both continuous and
00:46:24.680 the trap so you can I mean I I played it
00:46:26.559 in my in my regional I played this deck
00:46:28.319 in and I just like I found all sorts of
00:46:30.359 applications for it like I randomly just
00:46:31.839 like Drew four against Centurion or
00:46:34.520 something oh my goodness yeah yeah
00:46:37.200 that's the one of the matchup where you
00:46:38.640 you draw four you draw your Cosmic and
00:46:40.240 then you win
00:46:41.880 so beautiful card I was hoping to
00:46:44.240 resolve it not this not the metaverse I
00:46:46.720 was really hoping to resolve the
00:46:47.760 metaverse it's so cool wow wow but I was
00:46:50.160 hoping to resolve D barrier for Link
00:46:51.720 monsters oh simel Arch fiend so you
00:46:54.079 can't like what is that it prevents link
00:46:55.440 climbing right yeah it just stop link
00:46:57.119 climbing you play literally every
00:46:58.520 Floodgate in the side deck tons of fun
00:47:00.559 for everyone all right I'm going to let
00:47:01.880 your subscriber play and appreciate the
00:47:03.960 game though yeah appreciate you for
