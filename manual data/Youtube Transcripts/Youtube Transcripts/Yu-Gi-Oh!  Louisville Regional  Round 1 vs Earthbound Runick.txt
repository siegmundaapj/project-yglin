00:27:54.279 special Su yeah yeah it's fine honestly
00:27:56.840 cuz this hat in her summon but it's a
00:27:58.480 spell that's summoning both of these
00:27:59.880 that's I think I don't think it I don't
00:28:01.760 think I would banish this one and not
00:28:03.440 that one it would make sense yeah maybe
00:28:05.399 I I don't
00:28:11.279 know that would have been a lot of
00:28:14.720 damage I was
00:28:16.760 like that would have been good for sure
00:28:22.760 man a little weird little
