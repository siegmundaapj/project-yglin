00:00:02.560 position of power where does your deck
00:00:04.839 fall among the rubble every 2 weeks a
00:00:07.640 tournament is played out but for every
00:00:09.719 archetype that makes it to the final

00:00:56.000 Phantom Beast all right what do we got
00:00:58.120 here it's a mega Raptor plus a black
00:01:01.000 garden and draw muscle oh boy into uh
00:01:05.280 set three here small piece Golem amazing
00:01:09.320 that's uh is that CT wi freaking Colt wi
00:01:11.759 we're going to get hit with punching the
00:01:13.280 Box punching my freaking chocolate box
00:01:16.159 what is this when your opponent's
00:01:17.240 monster declares an attack wildly
00:01:18.799 control two or more monsters Target the
00:01:20.280 attacking monsters negate and send
00:01:21.880 another
00:01:22.720 [Laughter]
00:01:25.119 monster that's so garbage uh all right
00:01:28.360 flip summoning small piece gold Golem
00:01:30.720 which actually clears the Mecha Phantom
00:01:32.960 Beast and sets another card here all
00:01:36.079 right what do we got here that's uh
00:01:37.360 Mecha Phantom be stealth
00:01:39.720 Ray normal summoning rockstone Warrior
00:01:43.600 uh which is big enough to attack a rose
00:01:45.439 token that's crazy uh stealth R
00:01:48.200 unfortunately is massive some token
00:01:52.439 gives your reporter a token into draw
00:01:55.399 muscle oh does this card just Target
00:01:57.960 defense muscle you control with 1,000 or
00:01:59.320 less defense draw one card uh and I
00:02:02.119 guess it can't be destroyed by battle
00:02:03.479 that turn that's insane that's my link
00:02:06.000 three monster in freaking masacus by the
00:02:07.960 way star regulator did you just
00:02:11.120 misplay like while the control token
00:02:13.280 this Camp you tried to destroy the
00:02:15.519 stealth right while they control a Mecha
00:02:17.599 Phantom Beast Token the one gimmick of
00:02:20.120 this deck and you didn't read it that's
00:02:22.080 so funny the one single thing that this
00:02:25.519 deck does is have Synergy with the
00:02:27.640 Phantom Beast tokens to not be destroy a
00:02:29.120 b card Effect in you lost to it all
00:02:31.360 right here's another draw Muscle

00:06:23.479 the top of your deck to the graveyard

00:06:39.599 water idiot um we're attacking with
00:06:42.319 submarine frog clearing Laval the great
00:06:45.720 to with these things this like Aqua

00:07:32.280 kiit coloss by the
00:07:33.919 way uh you know I wouldn't be surprised
00:07:36.680 if if you're still going to be in a bit
00:07:37.759 of a struggle here what does this do it
00:07:38.960 shuffles back Laval and then bounces a
00:07:41.199 card I put back two Laval and bouncy

00:07:47.000 then into a Laval duel slash I've never

00:37:22.800 right right I mean what's
00:37:25.680 left you know just
