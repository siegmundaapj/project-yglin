00:00:26.960 tip destruction revealer of the ice
00:00:29.439 barrier freezing and nib okay so I don't
00:00:32.159 know what any of the new cards do for
00:00:33.960 this archetype honestly probably even
00:00:35.520 some of the old ones uh so this card is
00:00:37.800 a level four uh wat spellcaster okay not
00:00:41.360 a tuner says while you control another
00:00:42.800 ice barrier monster your opponent cannot
00:00:44.320 tribute summon okay interesting uh then
00:00:47.280 it says you can only use each of the
00:00:49.480 following effects of this card once per
00:00:50.960 turn uh then it says you can discard one
00:00:53.120 card for cost special summon an ice
00:00:54.840 barrier Tuner monster from the deck also
00:00:57.640 you can have special monsters for the
00:00:58.879 rest of the turn except for water
00:01:00.160 monsters if you would discard or send a
00:01:02.920 card from your hand to the graveyard to
00:01:04.720 activate an ice barrier monster effect
00:01:06.680 you can banish this card from your
00:01:07.960 graveyard instead of one of those cards
00:01:11.000 okay okay um so they're going to go
00:01:14.479 normal summon effect discard and then
00:01:17.280 ghost special summon out hexa Spirit of
00:01:19.920 the ice barrier oh this card's got cool
00:01:21.759 art uh it's a level one tuner says why
00:01:24.920 you control another ice barrier monster
00:01:26.880 monsters your opponent controls lose 500
00:01:28.920 attack and defense and says during the
00:01:30.479 main phase you can send at level three
00:01:31.840 or lower uh ice barrier monster from the
00:01:34.280 deck to the graveyard if you do this
00:01:35.520 card's level becomes the same as that
00:01:37.240 monsters until the end of the turn you
00:01:38.600 can only use this effect of hexa spirit
00:01:40.759 the ice barrier once per turn so effect
00:01:43.159 to go dump and then we're going to dump
00:01:44.920 mirror magic Master of the ice barrier
00:01:47.399 level two tuner uh it says you
00:01:49.680 contribute one other effect Monster uh
00:01:53.640 for cost you can have special monsters
00:01:55.200 from the extra de for the rest of turn
00:01:56.439 except for water Synchro monsters also
00:01:58.840 special summon up the three ice barrier
00:02:01.759 tokens level one and if you do increas
00:02:03.960 this card's level by the same
00:02:07.599 number okay so you can summon like three
00:02:09.878 tokens and then make it gain three
00:02:11.239 levels that's cool then it says if this
00:02:14.080 card sent to the graveyard you can add
00:02:15.920 one ice barrier cards that is banished
00:02:18.239 or in your deck to the hand except for
00:02:19.680 another copy of itself you can only use
00:02:21.879 each effect of this once per turn Okay
00:02:24.080 cool so they're going to go ahead and
00:02:27.120 then wait is whenever it's on to the
00:02:29.080 graveyard oh yeah it's whenever it's s
00:02:31.280 to the graveyard okay so they're going
00:02:32.879 to go ahead and search speaker for the
00:02:35.200 ice barriers oh and I'm pretty sure this
00:02:37.319 is actually a DB profile picture that
00:02:40.000 they have uh it says why you control
00:02:42.280 another ice barrier monster defense
00:02:44.080 position monsters your opponent controls
00:02:45.879 cannot change their battle positions you
00:02:47.480 can only use each effect of the
00:02:48.800 following effects of this once per turn
00:02:51.040 if you control an ice barrier monster
00:02:52.640 you can special summon this card from
00:02:54.040 your hand then it says if you troll an
00:02:55.959 ice barrier monster you can banish this
00:02:57.400 card from your graveyard to summon out a
00:02:58.959 level one token
00:03:00.480 okay so when they add that yeah they're
00:03:02.120 going to drop droll now and then chain
00:03:04.440 runic tip to go search grab out Fountain
00:03:07.799 make them banish but we are locked
00:03:12.040 into water okay yeah and there's no
00:03:15.239 runic water okay so I guess we'll just
00:03:18.599 like you know get Fountain draw on their
00:03:20.000 turn then uh activate speaker to special
00:03:22.680 summon out overlay make bahmed shark
00:03:25.200 bahmed shark effect attach summon out
00:03:27.159 totally awesome I was also thinking like
00:03:28.799 this is a level two a
00:03:30.360 so you know I kind of expected toad to
00:03:31.959 come out one way or another um but okay
00:03:34.360 summon that now and then link off to
00:03:37.040 make marest Coral effect special summon
00:03:40.319 back out the mirr magic and then mirr
00:03:42.720 magic tribute to go summon out a bunch
00:03:45.560 of tokens okay uh then okay they don't
00:03:50.200 use this effect I guess this only adds
00:03:52.640 back a mar never mind never mind never
00:03:54.280 mind I was thinking about the wrong
00:03:55.239 thing for a second um but they're going
00:03:57.439 to go ahead make deep sea Prime
00:04:00.519 Donna okay cuz we brought out three
00:04:02.760 tokens making it level five use two
00:04:04.920 tokens okay going into a level seven uh
00:04:07.280 says your opponent cannot Target a
00:04:09.480 Synchro monster that use this card as a
00:04:11.840 material with monster effects then it
00:04:14.480 says uh you can Target one of your
00:04:16.600 opponent's banish cards add it to your
00:04:18.680 hand or special summone one level four
00:04:20.639 or lower water monster from your deck
00:04:22.560 and if you do add that Target to their
00:04:24.280 hand then if this card is sent to the
00:04:26.120 graveyard you can Target one banish card
00:04:27.600 and Shuffle it into the deck okay so
00:04:30.520 we're just going to use the effect uh
00:04:32.199 Target bonfire so how is that summoned
00:04:35.759 okay yeah yeah yeah they didn't know
00:04:36.960 that the levels of that went up so add
00:04:38.919 bonfire back to hand and then go summon
00:04:41.639 out okay sure summon out barrier statue
00:04:45.360 from the deck nice activate Fountain set
00:04:49.000 destruction

00:04:56.680 there it's in your hand right no it adds
00:04:59.080 to their hand and yeah and then now pass
00:05:02.560 turn draw black Witch uh next barrier
00:05:05.759 stach you to be banned okay
00:05:08.800 so
00:05:10.440 uh I
00:05:12.320 mean yeah that's just game because all
00:05:15.039 we have is polar into Temple which can
00:05:18.360 try to beat over but they'll definitely
00:05:20.240 stop Poplar with either drite or toad in
00:05:24.360 our eyes but we know uh as like a
00:05:27.479 commentator cuz we can see the back row
00:05:29.120 they're just going to destruction Temple
00:05:31.000 and then win anyways so yeah they just
00:05:33.039 go ahead and Adit the feat said I found
00:05:35.360 this uh in like 2 minutes okay so I
00:05:39.680 found this combo in like two minutes so
00:05:41.280 onto the next game we'll see the real V
00:05:44.479 go first we have draw wanted imperm the
00:05:46.880 fiend Smith called by they have madon of
00:05:50.560 the ice barrier which is Roa tip uh
00:05:54.280 flashing mirror magic master and nib
00:05:58.199 okay so they have just nib here
00:06:00.319 um so we're going to go activate the
00:06:01.600 fiend Smith discard go search out the
00:06:04.680 tractus activate tractus uh go ahead
00:06:07.840 search discard the lurry lri summon
00:06:10.280 itself out make the requium and then rum
00:06:14.360 effect tribute bring out the fiend Smith
00:06:16.400 from the deck fiend Smith graveyard
00:06:18.319 effect special summon and put back and
00:06:21.639 then use those to make the
00:06:24.680 sequentia and then activate the effect
00:06:27.120 to go fuse where they said on summon I'm
00:06:29.160 actually going to go ahead and drop nib
00:06:31.039 there okay um yeah cuz if you don't then
00:06:35.400 I guess they can set up like
00:06:37.479 DDD which just beats It Anyways okay so
00:06:40.720 now we're going to go activate wanted go
00:06:42.960 search out black witch and then special
00:06:45.840 black wit but I don't know how many
00:06:47.000 people are actually playing the DDD card
00:06:48.880 in this deck because like it's good but
00:06:51.919 like I guess they don't know it's snake
00:06:54.199 ey yeah so I guess it's fair uh now
00:06:56.960 we're going to go special summon the
00:06:58.000 fiend Smith engine becoming just like a
00:07:00.440 bait engine yeah it's so powerful so
00:07:03.000 summon discard draw effecto set
00:07:05.599 original uh because I have to nib you or
00:07:08.160 you make the rank six neate uh now we're
00:07:10.639 going to go original send bring out
00:07:12.400 snake ey Ash snake ey Ash effect and the
00:07:15.319 pop then summon out Poplar uh Poplar
00:07:19.120 effects so which do you play DDD or
00:07:20.919 beatris I said beatris because you can
00:07:22.879 make
00:07:23.759 apple okay I wonder if they can make
00:07:26.280 apple right away afterwards though um
00:07:29.319 that popular Divine Temple activate
00:07:31.280 Divine Temple Place snake ey diabar
00:07:34.039 snake ey Ash effect send bring out oak
00:07:36.479 oak effect special back out the snake
00:07:38.520 eye Ash uh I think DDD is better it
00:07:41.520 makes Dodge nib better uh to be fair
00:07:44.879 like the opponents won't know what
00:07:46.360 you're playing so they just have to drop
00:07:49.159 it before otherwise they get hard
00:07:50.919 punished by you making DDD and then
00:07:52.400 their nibs Dead uh the idea is that if I
00:07:55.479 just draw the idea is I draw just the
00:07:58.039 fiend Smith I can still Cal
00:08:00.080 or if I draw engine it's a one card Appo
00:08:03.240 okay so now we're going to make IP oh I
00:08:05.400 guess they just don't make beatus okay I
00:08:07.039 guess they just turn the bodies into
00:08:08.919 Appo and then summon black witch okay
00:08:11.080 okay that's fair they don't make pis
00:08:13.080 into Appo uh summon out snake ey di ball
00:08:15.639 star spell trap zone and then activate
00:08:17.960 Oak effect send bring out flame Burge
00:08:20.800 that is good and now IP plus flame Burge
00:08:23.759 make Promethean Princess Flame Burge
00:08:26.039 summon back out two from the graveyard
00:08:28.440 and then princess back out flame bir
00:08:30.639 from the graveyard flame bir Spell
00:08:32.200 trapzone IP uh then we're going to go
00:08:34.519 ahead make H and then link off into a
00:08:38.360 huge appala there with 32 wanted banish
00:08:42.958 put back draw into a fiend Smith tractus
00:08:46.720 and then set imperm called by pass they
00:08:49.880 draw the hexia spirit here okay so how
00:08:54.399 is the opponent going to try to deal
00:08:55.959 with this they're going to go activate
00:08:57.399 the madon to go search search out the
00:09:00.200 revealer sure flashing fire pop appala
00:09:04.160 make him banish black witch and a fiend
00:09:05.959 Smith uh they banish way too many yeah
00:09:08.440 it only banishes two we do see cross out
00:09:10.519 in their deck uh but it's game two so
00:09:13.040 it's not you know as cool I guess cuz
00:09:16.040 you can definitely side into it I don't
00:09:17.480 know if they main deck it or not uh but
00:09:19.720 normal summon out revealer Temple to
00:09:22.000 summon out IP trying to play around
00:09:23.560 destruction because if they chain
00:09:24.760 destruction then we just chain flame
00:09:26.160 Burge so they're going to go activate
00:09:27.959 runic tip go search freezing banish one
00:09:31.760 and then the banish veiler IP effect
00:09:33.839 chain freezing banish three okay and
00:09:36.959 then activate the revealer effect the
00:09:39.519 discard and now go ahead and special
00:09:41.720 summon out but we're going to imperm
00:09:43.560 that that seems like a very good
00:09:45.160 imperm mirr magic to go search and then
00:09:48.800 we just called by that uh they have no
00:09:51.519 battle phase we still have Promethean
00:09:53.160 Princess Pop two and then tons of
00:09:56.519 followup so they're going to link off
00:09:58.680 into SP
00:10:00.279 and then they said yeah someone's fine
00:10:02.399 they just like skip battle phase pass
00:10:04.160 draw mner and then go main phase uh so
00:10:08.200 now they said that called by really hurt

00:10:12.399 attack battle phase beat over and then
00:10:15.839 yeah attack directly with IP well looks
00:10:18.560 like they just never did that okay uh
00:10:20.240 fiend Smith effect uh Shuffle back to
00:10:22.880 summon out and then link off into the
00:10:25.680 link two okay and then activate that
00:10:30.240 effect now okay and they just met the Fe
00:10:32.320 I was going to say because we also could
00:10:33.279 have used flame Burge to like spell
00:10:35.600 trapzone the IP there again uh but onto
00:10:39.560 the next game game number three we see

00:12:10.120 U then it says you can only use each of
00:12:11.440 the following effects of this card once
00:12:12.880 per turn if you control an ice barrier
00:12:14.839 monster you special sumon this card from

00:12:31.800 special summon out the hexia
00:12:34.600 spir then activate The Swordsman summon
00:12:37.199 out from hand uh they draw another one
00:12:39.519 here cuz they special summon from hand
00:12:42.399 yeah so they're supposed to draw one
00:12:44.199 there uh effect special summon back out
00:12:46.720 from the graveyard and then drop the
00:12:50.000 rock yeah um so rock Passover token you
00:12:55.160 know and they forgot to draw one so did
00:12:56.720 you draw the nib said no I had it okay
00:12:59.240 activate Fountain pass draw imperm uh
00:13:02.720 activate wanted go search black which
00:13:04.360 you know we don't have to shuffle
00:13:05.279 anything back either cuz you know they
00:13:07.560 have two and I'm pretty sure we'd have
00:13:09.519 to have eight um if you yeah so we' have
00:13:13.000 to have eight uh to equal the difference
00:13:17.000 uh wait during the inter phase if you
00:13:18.040 have more cards in your hand than your
00:13:19.120 opponent has plus six okay okay okay
00:13:22.560 okay so now we're going to go special
00:13:24.040 black which wait is it eight or would we
00:13:26.360 have to have nine because we do like
00:13:29.120 let's say we had eight cards in hand and
00:13:30.760 they end with two cards on field do we
00:13:32.160 have to shuffle back yeah I guess we'd
00:13:34.480 have to shuffle back to equal the
00:13:38.000 difference
00:13:39.680 ah
00:13:41.519 interesting so would that mean we have
00:13:43.360 to shuffle back until we just have two
00:13:45.240 in
00:13:46.240 hand huh actually I'm going to have to
00:13:49.000 learn exactly how that card Works
00:13:51.279 discard special black witch effect go
00:13:53.680 said original and then original send
00:13:56.120 black witch summon snake eye Ash snake
00:13:58.000 eye Ash effect go search go ahead grab
00:14:00.120 out Poplar and then summon out Poplar
00:14:03.680 Poplar effect go search and then grab
00:14:06.639 out the Divine
00:14:08.240 Temple that's fine and then we're going
00:14:11.000 to go flashing fire pop snake ey as make
00:14:13.440 them banish two and then Fountain effect
00:14:15.759 to put back and draw to so that will
00:14:18.519 draw them into destruction freezing okay
00:14:22.000 sure sure sure uh those are pretty good
00:14:24.839 draws but it probably just won't be
00:14:29.160 enough here yeah we're going to go
00:14:30.880 activate Divine Temple yeah definitely
00:14:32.320 won't be enough here as long as we like
00:14:34.320 even attempt to play around it so
00:14:36.600 destruction they're going to go ahead
00:14:37.920 make a banish cuz we could have
00:14:40.959 also I guess it's like fine the start
00:14:43.160 with that I was going to say cuz we also
00:14:44.680 could just like have tried to like SP
00:14:46.920 banish fountain or something and then
00:14:49.000 normal summon Oak and full combo but I
00:14:51.079 guess we can also like nightmare Phoenix
00:14:52.839 wanted put back uh draw to the muli uh
00:14:56.680 said when when the shuffle effect of Max
00:14:59.279 comes up uh I have to have six more
00:15:02.519 cards in hand than what you control yeah
00:15:06.160 so now they're going to go ahead make
00:15:07.639 Nightmare Phoenix and then popular
00:15:09.720 nightmare Phoenix they chain freezing to
00:15:11.880 make them go ahead banish three and then
00:15:14.519 okay sure hits like a snake ey Ash there
00:15:16.600 that's fine uh now we just going to
00:15:18.279 normal summon Oak effect special back
00:15:20.120 out from the graveyard yeah they just
00:15:21.639 submit the feet I was going to say cuz I
00:15:22.880 just like sun send uh flame birge and
00:15:26.440 then that's just too much cuz the
00:15:28.199 opponent's really on nothing here and we
00:15:30.160 can just like SP banish Fountain and
00:15:32.399 then they're really on nothing they have
00:15:33.680 to skip their next battle
00:15:35.480 phase uh yeah that's just game we could
00:15:38.720 also just go for like
00:15:41.279 uh there's like a couple different ways
00:15:43.240 to play this out too it's probably just
00:15:45.000 best to like I don't even know do you
00:15:46.920 just like SP this I PE spell trap zone
00:15:49.120 World C to banish list it doesn't come
00:15:51.000 back uh then you have like mner imperm
00:15:54.199 plus IP princess for the top deck your
00:15:57.319 IP doesn't make SP but it could go ahead
00:16:00.399 and make Appo so you have like infinite
00:16:03.600 yeah yeah they don't have anything said
00:16:05.959 GG's at least terminal Revenge comes
00:16:08.639 earlier this June uh the combo you did
00:16:11.079 was a lot better than I thought it would
00:16:12.279 be when you summon statue I was
00:16:13.959 devastated still depends uh from him but
00:16:16.959 I can do a plus4 combo that is sick have
00:16:19.639 a good one okay um yeah it's interesting
00:16:24.000 I wasn't really impressed by what I saw
00:16:26.120 the Synchro 7 the Synchro 7 summon
00:16:28.360 statue
00:16:29.720 that's really cool um but the ice
00:16:32.000 barrier stuff didn't seem like broken or
00:16:34.759 anything it seemed like you know a
00:16:36.120 decent little you know Arc Type uh I
00:16:39.639 don't know I don't know obviously it
00:16:41.199 only gets better from here though uh cuz
00:16:43.240 people just started testing it but
00:16:45.480 seeing how long the match was the match
00:16:46.920 was about 28 minutes long and with all
00:16:49.160 that being said the DB grinder signing
00:16:51.120 off peace have a nice day stay safe
