00:00:07.270 [Music]
00:00:21.840 ladies and gentlemen Duelists it's time
00:00:25.119 for the final of
00:00:27.320 2488 players culminating in this last
00:00:31.199 duel Joshua Schmidt in the red versus
00:00:34.160 Anthony winning the dice roll leading us
00:00:35.840 off with prosperity in the rescue Ace
00:00:39.559 deck versus Joshua Schmidt's a betiel
00:00:42.320 Synchro
00:00:43.960 strategy again the most represented deck
00:00:47.719 even in top car against one of the most
00:00:51.199 unique ones there but this doesn't mean
00:00:54.120 anything nobody has the advantage right
00:00:56.800 now and let's see these reveals from
00:00:58.920 Anthony
00:01:00.480 that's everything you could ask for
00:01:01.680 we've got defensive cards we've got
00:01:03.120 preventer as well as Rota the most
00:01:05.680 important piece of the puzzle in rescue
00:01:08.000 Ace the hydrant will we be going we woo
00:01:11.680 in this final let's find out what he
00:01:13.439 decides to pick
00:01:14.799 here and uh considers the options if we
00:01:17.439 need that starter and does indeed
00:01:19.000 actually go for the reinforcement of the
00:01:20.600 army to get the Warrior from the deck
00:01:24.040 here activates it immediately no
00:01:25.640 responses from Josh Ash Blossom doesn't
00:01:27.320 come down on the prosperity
00:01:30.479 going for the lifter
00:01:33.280 here yeah off to a pretty good start
00:01:35.720 honestly and uh this is actually the
00:01:37.960 first time that we get to com rescue a
00:01:39.600 and maybe for once we
00:01:42.320 get want to say it I mean it was Alberto
00:01:45.600 speak for the event and it's very close
00:01:48.840 ours unfortunately failed n but let's
00:01:52.159 see yeah something uh a little bit
00:01:54.240 different I suppose for uh us here at
00:01:56.640 least rescue Ace was massively
00:01:58.840 represented it was was I think I want to
00:02:00.759 say 16% of the total representation of
00:02:03.360 the entire event as uh actually no 12%
00:02:06.799 of the entire event alongside
00:02:08.758 Unchained and uh I suppose perhaps oddly
00:02:12.239 Unchained did not convert anywhere near
00:02:14.319 as well as rescue AED in fact resue a
00:02:16.720 dominating the top cut spot but not
00:02:19.319 actually going that deep into the top
00:02:21.040 cut but there is one final firefighter
00:02:23.760 remaining and his name is Anthony Lopez
00:02:25.879 here as we are dropping down turbulence
00:02:29.080 and things are about to get bumpy as we
00:02:31.000 set four cards directly from the deck
00:02:34.599 here what a
00:02:36.920 start all right we've got the four cards
00:02:40.440 from the deck here seted directly I mean
00:02:43.480 wow it's uh an incredible card and so
00:02:46.200 much uh value gained from a singular
00:02:48.879 boss monster and will we continue on
00:02:51.159 with some plays here to recycle with
00:02:53.040 plays like our sunlight wolf uh this
00:02:55.360 deck is in fact playing the proxy
00:02:57.200 magician version which sets up the terer
00:03:00.599 uh and that gives you the negate in the
00:03:02.239 graveyard for uh your turn one play
00:03:04.760 Let's see if he actually goes for
00:03:10.080 that all right and uh there is a search
00:03:14.599 here coming up absolutely let's see on
00:03:16.840 the other end Joshua obviously has a lot
00:03:19.080 of ways to disrupt this field going
00:03:21.440 second with his runic spells most likely
00:03:24.640 we have seen him all over and he has
00:03:27.519 gone through quite a significant top
00:03:29.799 bait he knocked two labrin decks with
00:03:32.640 both Joo and then dink Bui so he had
00:03:35.439 quite the rough Journey up to this final
00:03:38.560 goes for preventer here from the hand
00:03:40.560 making the mascarena not going into any
00:03:43.840 uh any proxim addition plays here so
00:03:46.120 Josh is going to draw for turn now and
00:03:48.319 fight through these last three set cards
00:03:50.680 as well as the IP most likely into SP
00:03:52.879 little Knight lots of uh disruption and
00:03:56.159 one card combos utilized in the rescue a
00:03:58.599 strategy probably why it's been so
00:04:00.040 popular this weekend it's just an all
00:04:01.640 round versatile deck that has so many
00:04:04.920 ways to just uh generate Advantage
00:04:07.480 control the field but will it be enough
00:04:10.480 seems like he has three monsters and
00:04:12.599 three spells so pretty even and
00:04:15.439 sometimes you want to see more evenly
00:04:17.399 matched perhaps you could
00:04:19.720 say that would have been a card here is
00:04:22.880 the Beast steel Rebellion being
00:04:24.000 discarded from the hand searching any
00:04:25.800 Beast steal from the deck here going to
00:04:27.639 get Magnum most likely doesn't have a
00:04:29.800 ton of uh Synergy in this match up
00:04:32.280 unfortunately the Beast deal is a little
00:04:33.360 bit weaker rescue Ace a full fire
00:04:36.680 engine literally an engine get it fire
00:04:38.759 engine uh so no light and darks to
00:04:41.280 banish uh to take advantage of the Beast
00:04:44.440 steals but we're going to get magnut out
00:04:46.479 of the deck regardless and I think uh
00:04:48.280 we're going to be mostly relying on our
00:04:50.919 runix to try and uh take this one down
00:04:54.199 here and we do have three spells in hand
00:04:55.600 here one of which is tip and that's
00:04:58.680 arguably the best one so why
00:05:02.080 not yeah this matchup uh is probably
00:05:04.759 something that Josh has played a lot of
00:05:07.080 going through this entire tournament
00:05:08.720 lots of representation as we mentioned
00:05:10.120 from Rescue Ace what do you think about
00:05:11.120 the rescue Ace match up versus runix
00:05:13.000 yeah I mean honestly I wouldn't be like
00:05:15.880 uh so disappointed if I were Joshua to
00:05:17.880 play against rescue a I mean the diral
00:05:19.520 was impactful because like this is huge
00:05:22.280 honestly you have the preventor which
00:05:23.840 basically gives you a free book of moon
00:05:25.759 let's say and uh I mean with this hand
00:05:29.759 being drawn by Joshua honestly it
00:05:31.400 doesn't help much because yeah here with
00:05:33.440 the three set from Anthony uh yeah
00:05:36.840 indeed it's just trying
00:05:39.520 maybe let J I mean I think Joshua know
00:05:43.039 what rescue is does right course we're
00:05:46.000 going to contain here it looks like um
00:05:49.160 that is let's see if there is a response
00:05:52.120 we know y but no doesn't seem like it so
00:05:55.560 we'll
00:05:56.560 resolve yeah so uh the rescue a cards
00:05:59.720 for those of you unfamiliar you uh have
00:06:01.800 a bunch of effects that you can activate
00:06:03.280 such as special summoning negating as
00:06:05.240 well as destroying uh but they also
00:06:07.440 benefit from Bonus effects when you have
00:06:09.680 the hydrant on the field here and that
00:06:12.280 is sort of the heart and soul of the
00:06:13.400 deck because it's extremely important to
00:06:15.000 maintain the hydrants presence so that
00:06:17.199 you can get maximum value out of all of
00:06:18.960 your spells and
00:06:21.120 traps and this is exactly the case here
00:06:23.919 magnut was negated but also now cannot
00:06:26.960 be used as material so this is a pretty
00:06:31.160 big here I'm uh curious to see if uh
00:06:34.639 we're actually in the battle phase
00:06:36.520 potentially because we could have went
00:06:37.800 battle phase uh with the magnut then try
00:06:40.280 and bait out mascarena but that's a
00:06:42.520 great card though discarded as he was
00:06:45.080 forced to banish the Rebellion he
00:06:47.160 actually has the S here which could just
00:06:49.160 replace it right away yeah it's a great
00:06:51.520 discard here we can activate the uh
00:06:54.080 hugan
00:06:55.680 potentially um it resolves yep it does
00:06:59.000 get good good Synergy off of that
00:07:00.440 discard because now the serer can dump
00:07:02.840 as well as searching out the all
00:07:04.639 important
00:07:06.919 Fountain sarer replacing itself here
00:07:09.960 with the Rebellion so the banish of the
00:07:11.520 magnut like I mentioned at the start not
00:07:13.440 a lot of synergy in this matchup because
00:07:14.879 you really lacking the light and darks
00:07:16.560 that your opponent can facilitate for
00:07:18.039 you to give you essentially free summons
00:07:19.360 and take away their resources so we're
00:07:20.879 going to have to use our own here but
00:07:22.800 it's okay staner fills up the grave
00:07:24.520 nicely which means lellan should be able
00:07:26.720 to become uh special sum to the field
00:07:30.039 and get that all important regained
00:07:32.400 up but now Anthony decides that he needs
00:07:36.240 to do something and apparently he is
00:07:38.680 about to put this face down which now
00:07:42.639 kind of prevents Joshua from using his
00:07:45.240 extra monster zone so could be quite
00:07:48.639 problematic yeah the extra monster Zone
00:07:50.639 kind of important here because it is
00:07:52.639 where you summon all of your uh runic
00:07:54.879 fusion monsters from so denying the
00:07:57.240 ability to uh utilize that right now
00:07:59.080 means means that we can't go into things
00:08:00.440 like chaos Angel we can't do our Synchro
00:08:02.400 plays and really important preventor
00:08:06.039 activation here don't forget we also
00:08:07.440 have the masquer online still
00:08:09.720 unused so a huge amount of uh disruption
00:08:13.159 still left from
00:08:16.280 Anthony and obviously we have seen
00:08:18.639 already Joshua key card in the deck
00:08:20.879 which is that branded regain to just
00:08:23.039 keep on accumulating Advantage But Here
00:08:25.400 Comes the tip even before the fountain
00:08:28.560 just because of the masarina
00:08:31.279 threat yeah runic tip might have to try
00:08:33.958 and search for something that deals with
00:08:35.519 masarina before we can commit our runic
00:08:37.399 Fountain to field cuz you do not want to
00:08:40.000 have your uh Fountain disrupted here you
00:08:42.240 can quite easily protect it generally
00:08:44.399 with the hugan but unfortunately that's
00:08:45.839 been set face down so our next uh order
00:08:49.040 of operations that we're going to have
00:08:50.080 to deal with is the mascarena and it
00:08:51.880 looks like Josh is trying to find a tool
00:08:53.839 to deal with it either going for hydrant
00:08:55.640 or mascarena here absolutely the
00:08:57.760 flashing Fire Let's see what he banish
00:08:59.600 is off the top nothing too relevant it
00:09:01.560 seems
00:09:03.760 yeah yeah there's not a whole lot of
00:09:06.040 one-offs in the rescue a deck that
00:09:07.880 you're going to be getting quite
00:09:09.200 fortunate with because of the uh oh
00:09:11.440 actually does commit the fountain
00:09:12.519 immediately here okay all right so I
00:09:16.079 think that we're probably going to try
00:09:18.279 and resolve the fountain but I think
00:09:19.920 Anthony does need to probably respond
00:09:21.800 here yeah or at least in response to a
00:09:24.440 runic being activated otherwise on the
00:09:26.279 new chain will be able to uh
00:09:29.720 activate the SP when
00:09:32.959 chained but doesn't seem like that's the
00:09:35.079 case the problem is you have the
00:09:36.360 flashing fire so you can just change
00:09:38.160 that to the mascarena but finally we get
00:09:40.720 to see this part of Joshua's deck we
00:09:43.320 have been waiting for a while for this
00:09:45.920 quem and now we finally get to see one
00:09:50.399 yeah quem is uh sort of the other kind
00:09:53.440 of normal summon engine of the deck here
00:09:55.120 because it allows you to facilitate more
00:09:57.480 uh Synchro plays it's also a light and a
00:09:58.880 dark which is pretty synergistic with
00:10:00.800 your Beast deals you can send the cesia
00:10:02.680 from your deck to the graveyard and if
00:10:04.120 you control a fusion at the end you can
00:10:06.079 return it to the hand for more resources
00:10:08.560 and does allow you to go into Synchro
00:10:10.120 plays here now it's important as well
00:10:12.240 because uh quem is a light rather than a
00:10:14.560 dark so it does mean you get a lot of
00:10:17.240 good uh value from uh chaos Angel if you
00:10:20.279 decide to go into
00:10:21.600 that and also with The Duality I was
00:10:24.200 thinking you know when I was a shuffler
00:10:26.760 you know because light and dark monsters
00:10:28.360 that they have
00:10:30.160 know
00:10:33.160 yeah all right we're uh chaining the
00:10:36.120 Trap here cuz we do not want to have
00:10:38.519 lellan
00:10:39.720 resolve so the regained is a super
00:10:44.120 important aspect of the deck here we're
00:10:45.760 going
00:10:46.639 to Lumber wow wow so the extinguish
00:10:51.480 being stopped by the Slumber protection
00:10:54.000 here so that we can keep our Rebellion
00:10:56.079 on the field and on the new chain as
00:10:57.800 well really important importantly
00:11:00.160 Fountain does have three Targets in the
00:11:05.200 graveyard and this is where things can
00:11:07.200 get really scary once you start
00:11:08.760 resolving Fountain things can really
00:11:10.800 snowball out of control because that is
00:11:12.600 when you generate all of that advantage
00:11:14.240 and then you dig into more disruption
00:11:15.920 and then it just keeps going and going
00:11:17.440 until your opponent is depleted of
00:11:18.639 resources and you've aced a Advantage
00:11:21.040 upon your opponent of like five plus
00:11:23.800 cards let's see if Anthony can do
00:11:26.720 anything about this here this
00:11:27.959 extinguishes
00:11:30.000 yeah just a huge Dodge on the uh on the
00:11:34.040 Slumber but now IP yeah IP mascarena
00:11:36.680 here being activated so we do know that
00:11:39.079 Josh searched out the flashing
00:11:43.240 fire yeah just considering the options
00:11:45.320 here before resolving this flashing fire
00:11:46.880 but I think it's very likely we're going
00:11:48.120 to have to stop this mascarena and there
00:11:49.839 it is it comes down here targeting
00:11:52.880 mascarena all right chaining the the
00:11:55.480 rescue here yeah the alert on the
00:11:57.519 turbulence it seems like alert
00:12:03.350 [Music]
00:12:05.800 yeah and yeah seems like the chain will
00:12:08.839 now resolve and what a Shain it was
00:12:11.200 indeed two off the top here okay and
00:12:15.880 yeah huge chain being resolved here this
00:12:18.440 was really important we needed to have a
00:12:20.160 way to deal with mascarena and that is
00:12:22.800 uh the most important part of the
00:12:24.680 strategy is to resolve this Fountain as
00:12:26.279 we target these three spells recycling
00:12:28.519 them back into the deck and then drawing
00:12:30.760 three more you can see here Anthony is
00:12:33.360 uh getting a little bit out grinded
00:12:35.000 right now but now that Anthony has gone
00:12:39.320 for the alert back on the turbulence
00:12:42.680 this is what we will try to
00:12:48.600 do so I think uh what Anthony is trying
00:12:51.399 to do here is to dodge uh or rather use
00:12:54.240 the effect of the turbulence to destroy
00:12:56.040 a card on the field here and that is
00:12:59.560 spot very very very well played
00:13:02.290 [Applause]
00:13:04.519 yeah Rebellion wow huge defensive plays
00:13:09.000 there by Anthony what a play by Anthony
00:13:10.839 big spot there to trigger the turbulence
00:13:12.399 in response uh sequencing that perfectly
00:13:14.680 as well to make sure that the turn
00:13:15.839 player priority resolves in Josh's favor
00:13:17.760 so that he uh can then use the
00:13:19.959 turbulence as the chain link to that's
00:13:22.079 it and that's it a turn by wow
00:13:25.519 unbelievable that is really really well
00:13:27.760 played from Anthony Josh was looking
00:13:29.040 like he was maybe in the commanding seat
00:13:31.000 there but yeah Anthony uh navigated that
00:13:33.920 really well yeah that was good catch
00:13:36.000 honestly with the great great play from
00:13:39.120 Anthony I mean we mentioned it already
00:13:41.959 ycs finalist so two time finalist that a
00:13:44.839 Ys is no joke yeah this is where things
00:13:47.560 get really out of control here we got
00:13:48.720 the headquarters being resolved here it
00:13:50.639 is just an infinite cycle that you can
00:13:52.240 do with this deck putting back your
00:13:53.800 banished as well as in the graveyard
00:13:55.920 rescue a spells and traps and you can
00:13:57.720 just keep resolving turbulence and the
00:14:00.240 uh uh recycling so you could just keep
00:14:03.079 using these over and over and over again
00:14:05.880 what a show off from an amazing res
00:14:08.959 alert extinguish contain the uh fire uh
00:14:13.560 rescue Ace strategy is just in full flow
00:14:16.560 here if you didn't need a display of
00:14:19.040 such perfect gameplay from Rescue Ace
00:14:20.800 you've seen it now Anthony doing really
00:14:22.440 really well here to keep Joshua Schmidt
00:14:24.279 at
00:14:25.680 Bay with that alert honestly I think
00:14:28.320 that that was the game changer yeah for
00:14:30.240 sure that's a huge the game would have
00:14:31.720 been uh probably over on Joshua's favor
00:14:34.639 but instead Anthony found the line and
00:14:38.360 look at this Advantage usually it's the
00:14:40.759 runic deck who you know can uh get ahead
00:14:44.600 in terms of card Advantage but wow yeah
00:14:47.279 just creating so much here because of
00:14:49.199 that headquarters hugan goes back into
00:14:52.000 the extra deck but Josh is complet back
00:14:55.600 right zero cars in hand zero cars he has
00:14:57.639 nothing in hand right
00:15:01.040 wow yeah that's really rough here Josh
00:15:03.800 is going to need something huge off the
00:15:06.199 top here to try
00:15:07.440 and come back into this game here but I
00:15:09.959 don't even know what you can possibly go
00:15:11.399 for because runic Fountain is going to
00:15:13.839 need another runic to resolve in order
00:15:15.440 to actually maximize its efficiency here
00:15:17.600 and well Anthony still potentially can
00:15:19.720 go for more uh link plays in main Phase
00:15:22.160 2 setting up I mean whatever he likes
00:15:25.519 can go into an SP Ste that we haven't
00:15:27.160 used yet and uh yeah we'll see if we'll
00:15:30.639 see the proxy magician lines come out
00:15:33.360 and he is exactly what he's going for
00:15:35.920 but not just goes for a regular SP
00:15:38.160 passes play back to Joshua will now go
00:15:41.959 for the
00:15:43.399 C
00:15:44.920 see C returned from the graveyard here
00:15:47.399 back to the hand as Josh draws for turn
00:15:49.319 that is two cards to a full Entourage of
00:15:53.000 rescue Ace mon uh rescue a spells and
00:15:54.839 traps set off of that
00:15:57.600 turbulence
00:16:01.399 tough okay we go for the cesia one more
00:16:04.959 Cor in end cesia can maybe go battle
00:16:09.079 phase try and attack over the hydrant
00:16:10.480 here but turn off the uh bonus effects
00:16:13.480 of the rescue a cards yeah that's
00:16:15.560 exactly what Josh is going to try and do
00:16:16.880 here but the preventer activates the
00:16:19.160 effect and that set the SCS it up that's
00:16:24.240 going to be game number one taken down
00:16:26.199 by Anthony incredibly well played with
00:16:28.720 the rescue a deck especially to spot
00:16:31.279 that with the uh with the destruction of
00:16:33.440 the runic Fountain and I probably assume
00:16:35.279 he maybe hasn't played against a lot of
00:16:36.600 runic yeah that was a good catch
00:16:38.480 honestly I think that he was
00:16:40.120 specifically waiting for the moment no
00:16:42.079 because like Joshua seems like if it was
00:16:43.839 dominating the game once again he came
00:16:45.560 back into the game after a very solid
00:16:47.279 start from Anthony and uh I mean game
00:16:50.240 one goes to him no it just goes to show
00:16:53.279 how close this matchup is and how close
00:16:56.040 this final will be between two amazing
00:16:58.519 amazing players that this weekend are
00:17:01.759 just absolutely killing it but now that
00:17:04.760 we can take a quick look at their side
00:17:07.439 decks we can try and figure out what
00:17:09.679 their plan could be and we are thinking
00:17:12.839 maybe of a card that we didn't get to
00:17:15.039 see in action in the previous one yeah a
00:17:17.760 certain word held by a thunder monster
00:17:20.119 we could say maybe that come well yeah
00:17:22.520 denosa in this matchup could be quite
00:17:24.439 relevant we'll see if Josh decides to
00:17:26.520 bring that down there is a couple of
00:17:27.799 answers you can go for in rescue a
00:17:29.880 something like preventor to set it maybe
00:17:31.600 could could could work potentially we'll
00:17:33.919 see how exactly that plays out Josh also
00:17:35.480 plays fantasmi um could be okay in this
00:17:38.360 matchup you know there's a lot of ways
00:17:39.520 to um you know generate more Advantage
00:17:42.160 via your link plays and rescue Ace but
00:17:44.520 at the same time you know maybe
00:17:46.880 neiru potentially there's lots of lines
00:17:49.520 that help you play around that Josh's
00:17:51.039 side doesn't actually look super well
00:17:52.960 suited for this matchup um but yeah on
00:17:55.840 the side of Anthony uh for his side deck
00:17:58.000 I mean he get has to go second this time
00:17:59.440 and deals with the uh runic Deck with I
00:18:02.360 mean it's really popular we've seen it
00:18:04.039 in every single side deck it's been more
00:18:05.720 represented than Ash Blossom even this
00:18:07.840 entire tournament in all of our players
00:18:09.200 deck list that is droll and lock bird a
00:18:11.919 huge card that he could see in this
00:18:13.440 matchup that could potentially change
00:18:14.679 things around for him yeah we had seen
00:18:17.240 it again in the top eight match where it
00:18:21.120 seemed as if Joe Dr lock would
00:18:23.120 completely shut down Joshua but in the
00:18:25.559 end that wasn't the case but obviously
00:18:28.440 Labyrinth and rescue a are completely
00:18:30.159 different Labyrinth you know unless you
00:18:32.440 get things going and the entire setup is
00:18:34.520 kind of slower at setting up the game if
00:18:37.440 you take just one turn away as we have
00:18:39.600 seen here from rescue a uh that's gets
00:18:42.520 tough so maybe draw and loock is much
00:18:43.960 better in this particular matchup as
00:18:46.480 we're waiting for the players to side up
00:18:47.799 here you can probably see here just
00:18:49.080 about the beautiful Trophy up for grabs
00:18:51.960 this is the another verse gluton and
00:18:55.000 let's remind why they are dueling and
00:18:57.120 for what they are dueling this is it
00:18:59.440 obviously we have mentioned it today
00:19:01.679 during the course of the weekend you
00:19:04.440 know Simon top of Wis got his chance to
00:19:07.559 walk home with the oversight copy but
00:19:10.400 here they are facing off not only for
00:19:12.520 the beautiful trophy but for the ultra
00:19:14.799 rare price card of another verse gluton
00:19:18.600 and that is nothing to disregard so
00:19:21.799 there is a lot on the line of course
00:19:23.520 just as a reminder once again Joshua
00:19:26.400 trying to win his fourth ycs which is
00:19:29.520 just ridiculous thing to even mention
00:19:31.880 while on the other hand Anthony trying
00:19:33.840 his Redemption Arc from ycs Leon which
00:19:37.400 is just an epic story honestly epic
00:19:39.919 storytelling thank you guys for the
00:19:41.679 script some of us don't even have four
00:19:43.360 tops let alone four wins so uh that's up
00:19:45.799 for grabs here that's uh looking pretty
00:19:47.679 good absolutely yeah no this is uh
00:19:50.600 definitely a heavyweight matchup here
00:19:52.760 Anthony proving himself as a comp
00:19:54.840 competent finalist can he take it all
00:19:56.880 the way uh up again game against the
00:19:58.960 world champion of maedo I mean you must
00:20:00.600 be feeling pretty confident right now
00:20:02.000 right yeah I mean although I mean it's
00:20:03.520 been a Wass finalist the pressure must
00:20:05.840 must be H him honestly after you know
00:20:08.080 impressive year by Joshua and uh I mean
00:20:10.400 sitting there at the Ws final as a world
00:20:12.840 champion honestly I
00:20:14.320 mean it's a big deal and uh I think he
00:20:17.600 also did he lose a final I mean he won
00:20:20.400 three I think Joshua yeah I think he
00:20:23.000 lost the final or maybe I mean he made
00:20:24.880 out the top fours I'm pretty sure but I
00:20:26.440 remember if he lost the final few time
00:20:28.840 yeah a couple times but yeah question
00:20:31.360 actually I think he lost in the finals
00:20:33.320 of national for sure to alai Beck about
00:20:36.000 like back in the day we're talking about
00:20:38.039 but in terms of Ys is yeah maybe not
00:20:40.679 maybe it's undefeated in finals and now
00:20:43.320 we're jinxing yeah that could be I I'm
00:20:46.000 not sure though I'm not sure so let's
00:20:47.400 not count on that but just a small
00:20:48.880 update for you those of you at home
00:20:50.159 wondering why we have a bit of a delay
00:20:51.600 here we're just uh doing a small check
00:20:53.679 on uh some sleeves here um so we're just
00:20:55.960 going to have a double check make sure
00:20:57.520 everything is in order for the players
00:20:59.080 so that they can actually have um yeah
00:21:01.720 just a a good duel um for the rest of
00:21:04.080 this match here making sure everything
00:21:05.559 is in order nothing is damaged um so
00:21:07.799 that's what we're waiting on right now
00:21:08.919 as we uh are sitting here um for this
00:21:11.679 game number two here uh if it's possible
00:21:13.720 perhaps we can maybe bring up the deck
00:21:15.000 breakdown once again perhaps we can talk
00:21:16.880 about that um and just show you just
00:21:18.880 exactly what has uh unfolded this
00:21:20.720 weekend because I mean yeah we've talked
00:21:23.240 about the story uh all weekend that is
00:21:25.600 the diversity of the format and here is
00:21:27.400 top 6
00:21:28.720 four yeah and uh funnny enough we do
00:21:32.039 have you know what are the two most
00:21:34.320 represented decks in the final cuz we
00:21:35.960 have rescue Ace and other because this
00:21:38.360 is exactly what's going on here rescue
00:21:40.200 Ace was very represented it didn't
00:21:42.840 really perform that well throughout top
00:21:44.840 car but Anthony Lopez was the last one
00:21:47.000 standing and he's here one up but among
00:21:50.960 the different variety of decks Joshua
00:21:54.320 Smith was you know a loner as well and
00:21:57.440 that deck surely shocked us this weekend
00:22:00.880 uh it found along his line in the top
00:22:03.279 cut a lot of got to say Lighter dark
00:22:06.840 decks which is why his beastial side of
00:22:09.360 the deck really really shined but now in
00:22:11.919 the final he's up against a fire one and
00:22:14.520 those might not be as good but yeah
00:22:17.640 again just as a reminder we have had an
00:22:20.679 incredible weekend of Yu-Gi lot of
00:22:22.480 action I suggest any of you guys if you
00:22:24.240 have missed any of the future matches or
00:22:26.120 even our very cool I want to say

00:22:43.880 have had we had a very successful
00:22:47.120 ultimate time wizard event for 2005 with
00:22:50.159 hundreds of duelist Gathering and in the
00:22:53.520 end it was Danielle Estella another ycs
00:22:56.120 winner who walked home with with a copy
00:22:58.880 of Kao which was really really cool
00:23:01.960 giant card for this exclusive event so
00:23:04.960 I'm giving another way to just have fun
00:23:06.919 and competing Yu-Gi-Oh and uh we'll see
00:23:09.320 whether the next one will be and who
00:23:12.080 will take it home but yeah it's a lot a
00:23:14.320 lot of different events this weekend
00:23:16.120 yeah no time wizard 2005 notoriously
00:23:18.880 popular here in Italy and if you ever go
00:23:20.480 to a ycs for those of you watching at
00:23:22.200 home if you are interested in taking
00:23:23.279 part you know if you aren't actually a
00:23:24.799 fan of the the current format there's
00:23:26.279 plenty of public events with historical
00:23:28.039 time wizard formats going down um and
00:23:30.760 you know we uh host a lot of 2010 that's
00:23:34.120 really popular 2005 is what we have on
00:23:35.960 this weekend and huge prizes up for
00:23:37.720 grabs yeah and the level of the
00:23:39.720 competition honestly was huge because we
00:23:41.760 had as mentioned before Italian national
00:23:44.880 champions coming over yeah that was was
00:23:48.000 I mean a blast you know from the past it
00:23:49.520 was not easy to make top eight honestly
00:23:51.039 at this side event so just a small
00:23:53.760 update for those of you wondering we are
00:23:55.240 currently after game number one here
00:23:57.159 Josh wishman is down uh a game to
00:23:59.919 Anthony Lopez rescue Ace versus Beast
00:24:03.440 Synchro runic um players are currently
00:24:06.120 just uh reing right now um so once they
00:24:09.039 get that done we'll be able to jump back
00:24:11.080 into the table uh and get some more
00:24:13.320 action on the way but in the meantime
00:24:15.600 for our viewers so maybe you can type in
00:24:18.440 who you think is going to take this
00:24:19.960 finals just in chat type it in the chat
00:24:22.400 remember try not be too biased uh I know
00:24:24.799 who you'll be supporting um but yeah
00:24:26.640 Josh is done a game here you know he's
00:24:28.360 got a lot to fight back through uh last
00:24:30.600 feature match he lost game one complete
00:24:33.039 Breck and then reverse sweeped it so
00:24:35.279 there's so much drama to unfold here
00:24:36.960 potentially you know there's still a lot
00:24:38.200 to come uh your way right now yeah and
00:24:40.799 you know you know some of these fierce
00:24:43.000 animals when you push them against the
00:24:44.440 wall they become even tougher to beat
00:24:47.159 and that might be the case for Joshua
00:24:49.279 down again as mentioned one game but
00:24:52.080 still completely in this this matchup
00:24:54.799 can resume now as our dualist are almost
00:24:58.640 ready to fight it back once again and
00:25:01.679 we'll be able to see who will take this
00:25:04.320 one
00:25:05.840 home uh I think we might still be in the
00:25:08.159 process of side decking right now yeah
00:25:10.240 um but yeah the uh yeah so the sleeves
00:25:13.760 have been uh corrected um so yeah we're
00:25:16.279 just going into the siding process here
00:25:18.080 as uh you you got to make sure you got a
00:25:20.120 good side plan going into your game twos
00:25:22.320 and threes don't forget a lot of players
00:25:23.919 uh sometimes underutilize side decking
00:25:26.200 right at least 50% of your dels are
00:25:28.360 played with a side deck and players
00:25:29.760 sometimes don't practice it and have a
00:25:31.279 good game plan um going into uh their
00:25:34.039 games two and three do you have any uh
00:25:35.960 suggestions or advice for uh the side
00:25:38.240 absolutely absolutely I am a big big
00:25:40.520 side deck fan in terms of the Forum
00:25:43.520 absolutely that guy no not even joking
00:25:45.720 but yeah it's it's the number one thing
00:25:48.039 you should you should think about
00:25:49.399 because as you mentioned at least 50%
00:25:51.120 but most likely it's going to be 66 you
00:25:53.200 know so you you play more games with the
00:25:55.640 side deck and that's a really important
00:25:57.240 thing of your deck and I really like
00:25:59.559 experimentations and you can see already
00:26:02.200 in our two final is two completely
00:26:03.919 different opposite ways Anthony a lot of
00:26:06.600 different tech cards Joshua five free
00:26:09.080 offs and that's it so really solid
00:26:12.360 Choice from Joshua makes sense although
00:26:14.480 he has Ru it can he can throw multiple
00:26:16.080 cars he just wants maximum consistency
00:26:18.799 those five cars are the one he feels
00:26:20.399 like are the best and that has worked
00:26:22.360 out for him but again we have Anthony
00:26:25.840 against Joshua and we are ready to see
00:26:28.600 who will be the winner of game two let's
00:26:38.870 [Music]
00:26:43.320 go all right ladies and gentlemen
00:26:45.279 welcome back game two underway here at
00:26:47.240 the finals of ycs bolognia 2023 2,488
00:26:51.080 dualists have taken part in this event
00:26:52.880 and it all comes down to this last du
00:26:54.880 here runic tip is Led with here by
00:26:58.200 that's a good start uh your ability to
00:27:01.360 just search your deck for anything is
00:27:03.520 absolutely powerful and Josh actually
00:27:05.919 opting to go that's a big one he lost to
00:27:08.440 that card in game one and now that card
00:27:11.159 is for now at least gone on singular
00:27:14.039 banish off the top here and runic tip
00:27:16.240 hits a critical piece of the puzzle here
00:27:18.240 going for the runic Fountain uh reason
00:27:20.200 for that is uh sometimes easier to play
00:27:22.279 through different hand traps your
00:27:23.440 opponent might have just so you can
00:27:24.640 guarantee that you get the uh resolution
00:27:27.200 here
00:27:28.080 uh rather than holding out and searching
00:27:30.039 the fountain uh it's a good way to play
00:27:31.760 around droll and lockb
00:27:33.919 bird okay and now he's going to play
00:27:37.200 around wow what a
00:27:39.919 start yeah playing around the ash
00:27:42.080 Blossom on the fountain let's see if
00:27:44.880 there is uh some response from anony is
00:27:47.279 thinking about it chain link to for
00:27:49.600 hugan here as you mentioned protecting
00:27:51.679 the fountain from direct uh uh contact
00:27:54.679 from any sort of hand trap like the ash
00:27:56.360 Blossom which means that we will be able
00:27:57.919 to draw two cards here and then on the
00:27:59.360 new chain the serir can activate to send
00:28:01.039 the rebellion and if we have any other
00:28:02.799 beastial in our hand which very likely
00:28:05.200 we could see here because we're drawing
00:28:06.840 two cards uh that's going to facilitate
00:28:09.000 some Rebellion plays Well for now it
00:28:11.840 seems like Anthony's fine with this it
00:28:14.080 will resolve
00:28:17.200 and yeah so uh even if Anthony drew the
00:28:20.440 side deck drol on lock bir the question
00:28:22.200 is uh will it be enough here draw phase
00:28:26.760 runic tip
00:28:28.000 means you can't draw and then on
00:28:29.320 resolution you go to your main phase and
00:28:31.600 this is where you start performing
00:28:33.640 multiple searches off of that one chain
00:28:36.080 protecting you and insulating really
00:28:37.760 well so uh hasn't come up here but it
00:28:40.480 still is kind of relevant for S the
00:28:43.279 maybe are drone the regain let's see oh
00:28:45.840 no okay he does have theion okay got a
00:28:48.640 triple rebellion in her hand or
00:28:50.080 something maybe dumping the magnut
00:28:51.880 that's interesting okay promising start
00:28:54.039 from o the beastial Rebellion sorry the
00:28:56.679 beastial AL
00:28:58.320 uh this is a card that you don't see
00:28:59.960 very often here we actually haven't even
00:29:01.399 seen this in uh branded decks honestly
00:29:03.720 but the reason that this is valuable is
00:29:05.399 because it is a normal summon level for
00:29:07.159 tuner that is a searchable target from
00:29:10.279 lebell yeah addition pretty interesting
00:29:13.360 card and thanks to the runix this allows
00:29:16.159 you to get easily into a baron the Flur
00:29:19.399 for example pretty much like the NATA
00:29:21.760 runic deck that I mean Joshua even won
00:29:23.880 the World Championship with did so yeah
00:29:26.919 I don't know maybe he just thinks 5DS
00:29:28.480 was the best year of yugu and just wants
00:29:29.760 to be Synchro as much as possible cuz we
00:29:31.799 are going into a six here and that's
00:29:34.039 going to be the coral dragon and this is
00:29:36.159 exactly what I was mentioning second
00:29:38.159 copy of Fountain here which means that
00:29:41.080 we're going to get at least a draw one
00:29:43.399 as we go for the dispelling can go for
00:29:45.240 Jerry Jerry return the other Fountain
00:29:47.200 from the graveyard to the hand resolve
00:29:49.399 the fountain if we don't have any of the
00:29:50.679 more runic and uh oh that is yeah just
00:29:53.960 we are going to go yeah one goes to end
00:29:56.120 and one goes to the B
00:29:58.279 so only one draw we not saving for a
00:30:00.159 second one here but also the value that
00:30:02.480 corl dragon can offer as a Synchro up
00:30:04.399 into 10 means that it is a tuner Synchro
00:30:06.799 allowing you to access Baron and on top
00:30:08.240 of that when it goes to the graveyard
00:30:09.640 you can draw another card don't we just
00:30:12.360 love drawing cards not bad at all yeah
00:30:15.320 no yeah it's a very solid start and this
00:30:18.120 veiler is okay honestly I think I'm
00:30:20.000 happy if I'm Joshua yeah you're
00:30:22.279 completely fine with that there y effect
00:30:24.960 veiler comes down on Jerry we don't get
00:30:26.399 the second f I guess we're only going to
00:30:28.440 have to settle for drawing three cards
00:30:30.039 this turn what a
00:30:31.279 shame and we'll draw a fourth one with
00:30:33.559 corl right now so that's it's even more
00:30:36.320 here yeah yeah I bet Anthony is really
00:30:39.000 disappointed to have not drawn that all
00:30:40.919 important drone on lockb bird which
00:30:42.279 we've seen so many people play over the
00:30:44.039 course of this weekend really is the uh
00:30:46.440 Tech card of the
00:30:47.880 format and we see one more off the top
00:30:50.360 here with the coral Dragon question is
00:30:52.600 do we have a way to okay there's the
00:30:54.120 regain there as expected he did have the
00:30:56.840 regain the end and now let's see we have
00:30:59.320 any Beast we do actually have another
00:31:01.080 Beast deal what a hand from Joshua huge
00:31:04.600 summoning the Beast steal here just in
00:31:06.360 order to trigger the regain so that we
00:31:07.919 can put the uh Jerry back into the extra
00:31:11.240 draw one card I think we're up to five
00:31:14.480 this turn right yep y five awesome great
00:31:17.360 cycling your deck for five feels great
00:31:19.600 and then the regained added Resource as
00:31:21.600 well on your opponent's turn remember
00:31:22.880 every single time that your opponent
00:31:24.159 special summons once per turn you can
00:31:25.480 bring back a uh steal from your
00:31:28.000 graveyard and we did send the Magnum and
00:31:29.720 that's going to get a further search in
00:31:30.840 the end phase it it really is just card
00:31:33.080 Advantage the
00:31:38.720 deck from what I understand I don't
00:31:40.880 think Josh plays the Trap card for
00:31:43.440 Rebellion I think he's not playing it uh
00:31:46.200 let me no he's not I think he uh did
00:31:48.840 discuss with me a little bit before the
00:31:50.399 event if he was going to uh potentially
00:31:52.679 try and play it just for different
00:31:54.240 matchups in the side deck uh turns out
00:31:56.960 that he has opted to not go for that so
00:31:59.279 a uh another runic being activated here
00:32:02.840 I think that was the
00:32:04.600 destruction yeah again this allows him
00:32:07.399 to go once more into the Jerry and now
00:32:09.760 recover the fountain as it's not once
00:32:12.279 per turn and there goes the SP little
00:32:16.080 Knight the little Knight Synergy with
00:32:18.039 Baron the floor is absolutely disgusting
00:32:20.639 you can actually use the effect of Baron
00:32:22.799 negate a cardio opponent controls
00:32:24.480 activate little Knight banishing itself
00:32:26.279 and the baron Until the End phase the
00:32:28.039 baron returns to the field remember
00:32:29.320 Baron's effect is once while face up on
00:32:31.399 the field so then it leaves the field
00:32:33.279 comes back and then you can use the
00:32:34.360 negate
00:32:35.360 again yeah and there are so many
00:32:37.480 synergies not just that even they regain
00:32:39.679 the pluses Pito KN we have seen now
00:32:41.799 against dark or light decks makes for a
00:32:45.399 very nasty combo where you just banish
00:32:47.320 both but then Shuffle back while you
00:32:48.840 banish for your opponent and only your
00:32:51.159 little KN comes back so this deck is
00:32:53.000 full of you know
00:32:55.000 intrigas and yeah yeah we'll see if it
00:32:58.120 comes up here Anthony does have a lot of
00:33:00.200 good powerful light and darks in the
00:33:01.559 extra Deck with the cybur engine as
00:33:03.240 mentioned mascarena decoo U not decoo he
00:33:06.679 isn't actually a fire isn't he yet uh
00:33:08.760 but yeah there's a couple of
00:33:10.279 interactions that as you've mentioned
00:33:11.799 work really well this format and it's
00:33:13.399 probably why regained is such an
00:33:15.159 important piece of the puzzle here but
00:33:17.039 uh rescue Ace not going to be worried
00:33:19.519 too much here did he just pass turn wow
00:33:21.559 Anthony just passed back to
00:33:24.039 Joshua that is really unfortunate yeah I
00:33:27.600 mean there are a few duelist which I've
00:33:29.320 seen you know I remember Dinka was in a
00:33:32.240 previous format saying against the runic
00:33:34.240 decks sometimes you just want to do for
00:33:36.360 this because then they cannot really
00:33:38.679 attack you skip their turn but yeah it's
00:33:41.080 definitely unfortunate when you don't
00:33:42.840 have enough yeah there's a there's a
00:33:45.559 world you can just pass because you're
00:33:47.039 not in risk of uh you know losing the DU
00:33:49.360 since they can't go to the battle phase
00:33:51.840 um but I'm just worried that Josh might
00:33:53.639 get ahead a too far on no
00:33:57.960 as you see past so Anthony actually was
00:34:00.360 really with an up play here makes sense
00:34:03.039 all right now though we cannot really
00:34:05.080 play that game uh anymore we need to do
00:34:07.679 something and uh we have one additional
00:34:09.839 card to do that with so yeah I I guess
00:34:12.040 you could see it as some sort of
00:34:13.399 indirect one day of peace activation if
00:34:15.280 you really if you really squint hard
00:34:17.159 enough that's just what
00:34:20.440 happened so Anthony having another extra
00:34:22.760 card to uh have a turn here let's see if
00:34:25.918 he can do anything about cuz as you
00:34:27.520 mentioned no runic were activated on
00:34:28.760 Josh's turn Josh just goes draw a past
00:34:30.359 doesn't activate any Ric to resolve
00:34:31.719 Fountain because you will have to skip
00:34:33.079 another battle phase no point in that so
00:34:35.119 let's see if we can hold down the fort
00:34:36.399 with just the SP and the baron as well
00:34:39.440 as a mystery Set
00:34:43.520 Card well Anthony might have drawn
00:34:45.480 honestly cuz he's thinking about it but
00:34:48.679 uh yeah maybe he just doesn't see a line
00:34:51.639 that's uh that does it and there are
00:34:54.719 still 19 minutes left in in this 26
00:34:58.240 already down and this is going to be a
00:35:01.400 tough one for Anthony and he passes back
00:35:04.000 once again wow that is really unate
00:35:08.480 like gosh that's I mean full like hand
00:35:12.680 traps or something are the two vilers I
00:35:14.800 don't know like yeah that's that's
00:35:16.560 really rough here um Josh can probably
00:35:20.079 just I try and summon out maybe a beast
00:35:22.520 steal or two should be enough to round
00:35:23.839 out the game here but yeah but maybe he
00:35:26.440 has read again the okay no he's going to
00:35:29.800 bounce it back okay interesting so
00:35:32.720 Joshua probably sees a line where he can
00:35:35.560 uh end this duel right here and puts
00:35:38.960 back the baron and yeah does have a cram
00:35:42.200 yeah speal summoning the magnut out of
00:35:45.000 the graveyard with the tagout effect of
00:35:46.920 Baron versatile monster Omni negate as
00:35:49.040 well as that Synergy we mentioned with
00:35:50.480 little Knight but also recurring from
00:35:52.319 the graveyard and our normal summon
00:35:54.720 quen's going to dump cesia that's going
00:35:56.359 to give us more more followup if we
00:35:57.640 can't find a way to find game here but
00:36:00.280 with a six and a four we can indeed just
00:36:02.560 go back into the baron before we end our
00:36:04.480 turn here but first foremost let's see
00:36:07.079 if Josh can figure out any extra damage
00:36:09.440 right now it doesn't look like it
00:36:10.920 actually every deck has its strengths
00:36:13.200 and weaknesses drawing a million cards
00:36:15.880 and controlling the field really well is
00:36:17.359 one of them but dealing a ton of damage
00:36:19.400 sometimes uh runic decks can struggle
00:36:21.119 with that with the battle phase
00:36:22.000 restriction and just not being able to
00:36:23.319 put up so many uh big bodies and
00:36:25.680 monsters although the Beast Ste do
00:36:27.160 facilitate that quite nicely but not in
00:36:29.480 this situation Josh is going to have to
00:36:31.079 settle for remaking Baron yeah and now
00:36:34.720 there is essentially one more turn for
00:36:37.520 Anthony to do something to stay in this
00:36:40.240 game to otherwise we are going to go to
00:36:43.200 Just game three let's see Dre worm is
00:36:46.119 added back in the end phase here one one
00:36:48.040 more draw magnut searching from deck or
00:36:51.119 adding back from grave can't summon the
00:36:53.640 magnut now to try and generate free
00:36:55.319 Advantage because Anthony does not
00:36:56.960 control a monster so be steals aren't
00:36:59.200 completely
00:37:01.720 free and yeah Anthony essentially got to
00:37:04.200 just pass and see three extra cards over
00:37:06.119 the multiple turns there and yeah this
00:37:07.800 is it we need to play now we're going to
00:37:09.160 go diab Bel star sending a card from our
00:37:11.480 hand here we're going to dump that Head
00:37:12.880 Quarters from the uh hand to the Grave
00:37:19.640 there going to chain the sp sp little
00:37:21.680 Knight here and into enemy controller
00:37:24.960 okay let's see I saw this card in the
00:37:26.760 side deck of Anthony I was really
00:37:28.280 curious and wondering is that a card you
00:37:30.319 would bring in against runic yeah and we
00:37:32.599 just neg here with the baron all right
00:37:35.960 let's see if there is anything else from
00:37:38.000 Anthony at least we have baited both SP
00:37:40.640 and baron yeah that's a huge here we're
00:37:43.760 going to set off of the bellstar getting
00:37:45.960 the sinful spoil out of the deck here
00:37:49.040 and uh yeah the sinful spoil engine is
00:37:51.880 probably what took rescue Ace into
00:37:53.720 domination over the last couple of
00:37:55.000 months you've probably noticed that
00:37:56.119 rescue Ace pre uh age of Overlord wasn't
00:37:58.839 exactly an incredibly consistent deck
00:38:01.839 did have a lot of power and strength
00:38:03.720 around it but over the course of age of
00:38:06.680 overlords the sinful engine has just
00:38:08.319 given it so much consistency as we also
00:38:11.240 uh continue our turn here with
00:38:13.960 emergency I mean Anthony is trying
00:38:16.200 honestly I mean yeah is the
00:38:19.560 best roles so right now obviously Joshua
00:38:23.520 not really scared by this let's see not
00:38:28.400 a lot of responses here regained will
00:38:31.319 get to trigger on any summon and give
00:38:32.920 you Magnum more advantage and if we uh
00:38:36.160 have any more runix in our hand which
00:38:38.079 you know there's a chance that there uh
00:38:40.200 is after drawing so many cards that can
00:38:42.920 also snowball and further into more
00:38:45.400 draws off a
00:38:47.480 fountain here comes that emergency
00:38:50.000 bringing out the hydrant and tributes
00:38:51.960 from the hand a copy of the turbulence
00:38:55.119 yeah not looking too good for for
00:38:56.640 Anthony right now but Joshua on the
00:38:59.880 other end is going to use that regain
00:39:02.359 that gives him so much
00:39:04.319 advantage and goes for a flashing fire
00:39:06.960 from the end just one of the multiple
00:39:08.720 runic is probably holding yeah chain
00:39:11.040 link one regained chain link two
00:39:12.359 flashing fire to destroy the hydrant and
00:39:15.599 I think we're doing this just to try and
00:39:16.960 force out any other kind of uh rescue
00:39:19.839 Ace spells and traps we have in our hand
00:39:22.000 uh to stop any potential bonus effects
00:39:24.040 that might come down here I think
00:39:25.760 Anthony might have just one card in end
00:39:29.079 yeah let's see we have a discard then we
00:39:31.599 have the tribute so uh we've gone quite
00:39:33.960 minus here no maybe chew car yeah maybe
00:39:36.640 true card all right that's huge here
00:39:38.440 okay we're going to Target
00:39:41.000 the um
00:39:43.359 turbulence and in response we're going
00:39:46.520 to
00:39:47.880 alert is that rescue I swear rescue
00:39:51.800 rescue and alert look exactly the same
00:39:54.240 don't I think it's rescue right rescue
00:39:57.400 mhm Target a monster in the grave and
00:39:58.920 then you can special summon it to your
00:40:01.880 field can also bring back our opponent's
00:40:04.200 cards if necessary here here we go we
00:40:06.880 going to bring back
00:40:10.800 turbulence two cards of the top I think
00:40:12.960 that was a lifter we hit there but that
00:40:14.640 is a three of so not too worried about
00:40:16.319 that let's see if there is anything else
00:40:18.520 from Joshua to stop
00:40:22.319 this breing curse I mean we could see
00:40:25.240 the same as in the prev
00:40:27.000 so on summon here turbulence is
00:40:28.839 targeting the runic Fountain to destroy
00:40:32.280 so Josh deliberating whether he we want
00:40:34.680 to chain another runic to summon hugan
00:40:36.240 and then
00:40:39.359 protect I think is Joshua can also now
00:40:42.680 just use it and he going to go for both
00:40:45.359 the magnut and then the fountain cuz as
00:40:48.000 turn player Anthony has to be shink one
00:40:50.160 right here which allows Joshua to just
00:40:52.440 resolve the fountain
00:40:54.040 first yeah still gets value here because
00:40:56.319 is the turn player priority his Fountain
00:40:58.200 is always going to come last on the
00:40:59.440 Chain there that doesn't really matter
00:41:01.040 then so Fountain is gone but Joshua
00:41:03.680 still has drone shoe
00:41:05.720 cars must be some hand traps there if
00:41:07.880 we're not using any other runic I
00:41:11.480 suppose all right turbulence going to
00:41:13.280 activate the effect to set from the deck
00:41:15.040 here we already have one that's going to
00:41:16.599 be uh potentially solid the solid turn
00:41:19.079 though by Anthony again once again
00:41:21.119 trying his best to stay in
00:41:24.280 this extinguish contain and emergency
00:41:27.839 searched out of the deck here yeah
00:41:29.520 unfortunately there's no alert given
00:41:31.240 that he being banished
00:41:33.960 before yeah we can recur that with a
00:41:36.960 headquarters if necessary but I think uh
00:41:39.359 Anthony's already actually sent the
00:41:42.000 headquarters from the hand
00:41:44.160 so the long game is not what Anthony
00:41:46.839 wants to play here I
00:41:50.960 think is not used remember so we do have
00:41:54.400 some options available normal summon
00:41:58.520 yeah that's not how you counter
00:42:02.760 Fountain all right
00:42:05.440 um do we have any kind of I don't know
00:42:10.680 maybe an Al marage or something to climb
00:42:12.359 up to some cybers plays maybe but we are
00:42:15.440 going to see Joshua right here actually
00:42:18.920 ProMed that response and going to
00:42:20.839 special summon The Druids worm yeah
00:42:23.640 resolution the regain gets the recycle
00:42:25.680 the the Jerry we could draw one more
00:42:27.800 card off of her gain yeah and this is a
00:42:29.559 beautiful cycle but as mentioned here we
00:42:32.040 knew that the the belar at Ash blossom
00:42:35.880 in response here that's it wow that's
00:42:39.400 the final nail in the coffin for Anthony
00:42:41.200 the top deck Ash Blossom drawn from
00:42:44.240 those Fountain uh draws earlier is going
00:42:46.640 to be enough for uh for Anthony there
00:42:48.880 and we are going into game number three
00:42:50.599 now what a finals honestly we are
00:42:54.160 witnessing couldn't ask for more both
00:42:56.559 duel have been incredible up until now
00:42:59.119 and this is exactly what this matchup is
00:43:02.079 about I mean a lot of back and forth a
00:43:03.960 lot of advantage and a lot of what we
00:43:06.920 could say like vintage Yu-Gi-Oh was all
00:43:08.960 about which is card Advantage trying
00:43:11.200 even those plus ones and end up Ming but
00:43:14.960 now Anthony going to go first and going
00:43:18.079 to try to replicate what he did in game
00:43:20.760 one with some important additions from
00:43:23.440 the side deck most importantly that draw
00:43:25.760 and lock Bird yeah I think the uh gaml
00:43:29.480 that we've witnessed was uh probably
00:43:31.680 Peak Yu-Gi-Oh I think there was just so
00:43:33.599 much Back in Forth there was some really
00:43:35.160 good in intelligent plays there uh from
00:43:37.920 both players to navigate around each
00:43:39.680 other's disruption and yeah really well
00:43:41.880 played I think uh this is going to be a
00:43:44.240 fantastic game three yeah yeah
00:43:46.200 especially because like Anthony
00:43:47.359 basically passed for two for two turns
00:43:50.480 right and then basically was almost able
00:43:52.680 to come back into the game and uh
00:43:54.240 without having the alert in the game
00:43:55.640 still I mean with the ash Blossom Joshua
00:43:57.640 was able to seal the game and in here uh
00:44:00.680 there are three cross out designator
00:44:03.079 that Anthony may be hiding in if it
00:44:05.040 really feels
00:44:06.200 like uh I mean that might be good to
00:44:08.319 stop Josh Ash Blossom I'm really going
00:44:10.960 to have to find out some more about this
00:44:13.359 cross out uh in his side deck perhaps
00:44:15.400 we'll see it in a profile at some point
00:44:17.040 somewhere but there's a lot of uh
00:44:18.880 Curious targets here like he's playing
00:44:21.280 pearly like cross out for pearly that's
00:44:24.280 really interesting up but at the other
00:44:26.920 end I want to mention one thing from
00:44:28.760 Joshua side deck which is that if we
00:44:31.160 look at the time actually we got ahead
00:44:33.119 of ourselves but there are about 9
00:44:34.800 minutes remaining and there is a certain
00:44:37.559 carard that is one of the free offs in
00:44:39.440 Joshua's side deck and uh that is a car
00:44:43.720 that is a little spooky let's just say
00:44:45.680 that and that could actually come even
00:44:48.160 though there are only 9 minutes
00:44:50.160 remaining but without further Ado our
00:44:52.880 duelist are ready after two days there
00:44:55.720 is only one game remaining to Crown ycs
00:44:59.520 bologa Champion let's find out who that
00:45:02.760 will
00:45:03.230 [Applause]
00:45:07.860 [Music]
00:45:14.480 be can't hear it at home but the crowd
00:45:16.960 here has given us a loud roar for this
00:45:19.680 game number three we've gone tooth and
00:45:22.800 nail to fight through this entire uh
00:45:26.079 huge tournament that we've got here and
00:45:27.960 Anthony pushing through uh Joshua
00:45:30.480 equally involved with a massive uh just
00:45:35.200 just huge back and forth from both
00:45:36.720 players over the last game or two and
00:45:38.920 now it's time for Anthony playing at
00:45:41.000 lightning speed here recognizing looks
00:45:43.160 like as if only one minute remaining no
00:45:45.640 yeah he's playing as if we've got 30
00:45:47.480 seconds on the clock here but I think he
00:45:49.200 sees the lines the combos he's probably
00:45:51.319 done this a million times already and so
00:45:53.400 it's just about flexing those uh the
00:45:56.079 memory of uh the combo lines here as we
00:45:58.640 try and uh set up as quick as possible
00:46:01.359 because Anthony does know for sure that
00:46:03.640 Josh's deck uh the Ric deck can defend
00:46:06.040 itself uh really really well and is
00:46:08.240 super resilient to damage and can just
00:46:09.960 hold out here and so he knows that he's
00:46:11.680 going to need multiple turns uh in order
00:46:15.040 uh to try and deal damage and get to a
00:46:16.920 battle phase uh that actually
00:46:18.839 facilitates some damage for him and by
00:46:20.880 the way just saying this is the third
00:46:22.280 summon for Anthony just saying okay okay
00:46:25.440 okay okay but I mean the speed is quite
00:46:28.400 impressive from Anthony as mentioned and
00:46:31.839 uh well there are eight minutes
00:46:34.480 remaining and this is crazy crazy stuff
00:46:39.200 and to be fair come blaming for it now
00:46:43.760 we'll see this emergency it resolves
00:46:46.119 great news for Anthony yeah no Ash
00:46:48.079 bossom coming down here there was no
00:46:49.359 drone and lock bird summoning out the
00:46:51.559 turbulence tributing from the field Here
00:46:53.359 and Now turbulence can get four from the
00:46:54.720 deck that's going to give all of the all
00:46:57.359 important contain extinguish alert and
00:46:59.359 rescue uh onto the field here from the
00:47:01.880 deck to be able to uh start disrupting
00:47:03.960 plays and then try and get to that
00:47:05.680 battle phase on the turn three and deal
00:47:07.520 some damage as we are hitting just about
00:47:10.599 7 minutes on the clock here Josh is
00:47:13.040 thinking long on this turbulence here do
00:47:14.520 we have a response for it and that is
00:47:16.520 nir the Primal
00:47:19.280 being would you believe it the rock
00:47:21.720 comes down you were counting for a
00:47:24.359 reason I suppose the be comes down here
00:47:26.800 on the summon of
00:47:29.400 turbulence oh and a chain of Drew is in
00:47:32.520 response as well so that's going to send
00:47:35.000 the token um and Josh is uh yeah just
00:47:38.599 summoning a 3,000 body they're
00:47:40.079 preventing the turbulence from being
00:47:41.440 summoned and what can Anthony possibly
00:47:44.240 do right now that was the big play that
00:47:47.440 he had available to him was the uh
00:47:50.160 turbulence yeah that's crazy from Joshua
00:47:53.880 just what you needed there per perfect
00:47:56.200 perfect pairing and and wow Anthony yeah
00:47:59.599 just going to
00:48:00.599 passent and sets one card to pass turn
00:48:04.359 here as J in the end pH another magnut
00:48:08.079 and he's got three targets as well
00:48:09.960 because the dark Monsters uh link Kurio
00:48:12.520 was made in the graveyard Maga going to
00:48:14.040 get a search in the end phase for
00:48:15.440 Rebellion the beastial Alber whatever
00:48:17.520 you want and that's going to give you
00:48:19.839 well I mean as long as Josh doesn't
00:48:21.160 activate a runic card uh he can deal
00:48:23.480 some sort of damage surely only through
00:48:25.280 one singular backr remaining from
00:48:27.760 Anthony completely out of resources that
00:48:29.559 nabiru wiping away the entire field
00:48:32.400 unbelievable this is an incredible game
00:48:34.680 oh oh
00:48:36.559 my I mean I don't know and we got the
00:48:38.920 normal summon quen huge normal summon
00:48:42.280 with lellan as well in the hands here
00:48:44.359 and I forget dealing a little bit of
00:48:46.599 damage I think we could potentially try
00:48:48.119 and go for game right now a huge you
00:48:51.400 saying what game is this crazy crazy
00:48:54.160 opening the Magnum with one once again
00:48:56.760 limited but glued to Joshua end this
00:48:59.240 weekend and well this is an amazing turn
00:49:03.119 I don't know what happened we had a nice
00:49:04.520 little slow back and forth over the last
00:49:06.760 game or two big technical plays but now
00:49:08.880 we are just lighting the fire here as
00:49:10.680 both players going all
00:49:12.960 in there is the baron the floor being
00:49:16.079 summoned now activating the effect to
00:49:17.520 destroy the last spell and trap card the
00:49:19.200 only spell and track on the field it's
00:49:20.240 an infinite impermanence being forced
00:49:22.000 out
00:49:23.400 here sure yeah no you're fine with that
00:49:26.799 because Baron can only be used once
00:49:28.440 while on the field you no real reason at
00:49:30.160 all to negate this let that resolve and
00:49:31.680 you've got 3,000 damage through to the
00:49:34.599 life points directly does Josh have any
00:49:36.480 more
00:49:40.680 here unbelievable turn of events here
00:49:43.079 what a huge swing and it looks like we
00:49:45.599 have uh the activation in Hand of what
00:49:48.680 appears to be a another Beast steal yeah
00:49:51.160 yet another one that's the one he added
00:49:54.119 with the magnut
00:49:56.119 yep there's the sainer here curious if
00:49:59.240 we'll maybe send it at some point linked
00:50:01.640 away to dump Rebellion but I think uh
00:50:04.200 we're just trying to find some damage
00:50:05.760 right
00:50:07.040 now I think have to bom face no you know
00:50:10.359 in hindsight if Josh just destroyed the
00:50:12.319 monster and negated the imper I think we
00:50:14.079 would have had more than enough for uh
00:50:16.079 for a game honestly but all right this
00:50:18.599 is still going to be working out quite
00:50:20.240 nicely sarir sends lebell summoned out
00:50:23.799 going to send the card to the graveyard
00:50:25.160 set up
00:50:26.400 regained no access to Ren cards so far
00:50:29.119 but obviously no reason to use them
00:50:30.599 early them this works out I mean the
00:50:33.520 Rooney cards carried him all weekend but
00:50:35.960 right here in game three might win
00:50:37.359 without a single Rooney card yeah no he
00:50:39.480 just needs to get to the battle phase
00:50:40.799 and deal some damage and then we caner
00:50:43.119 Duality being activated spinning away
00:50:45.599 the Rebellion summoning out the deck the
00:50:48.359 extra deck rather scarlight red dragon
00:50:51.079 Arch f for damage in time if necessary I
00:50:54.400 don't know if it's going to be requ fire
00:50:55.680 but dualities bonus effect in the grave
00:50:57.480 recycling a light in the dark to draw
00:50:59.920 another as a wise man one said I'm a
00:51:02.520 banish a light in the dark but instead
00:51:04.160 we're returning it to the graveyard to
00:51:05.680 draw another card can we facilitate or
00:51:07.480 see any other pieces of the puzzle to
00:51:09.480 give us more damage here and just go for
00:51:11.839 game pure Beal how much damage can we
00:51:14.839 even do here we can do 6,000 and then
00:51:17.200 effect destroy that's going to be 75 we
00:51:19.599 need we just need 500 damage I think
00:51:22.160 that is yeah 75 yeah yeah
00:51:26.000 do we have anything else Josh just needs
00:51:28.240 500 damage from the hand in the battle
00:51:30.000 phase to be able to take this out here
00:51:31.559 looks like we're going to the battle
00:51:32.799 phase neiru the Primal being attacks
00:51:34.599 over and the preventer actually floating
00:51:36.960 back into the lifter here very important
00:51:39.160 um chooses not to uh negate with the
00:51:42.160 baron effect here yeah because it's
00:51:43.640 negated by imper of course the infinite
00:51:45.200 impers did resolve earlier yeah okay oh
00:51:48.359 oh oh oh oh oh but wait a second because
00:51:51.240 I have a
00:51:53.000 doubt wasn't the same regain column as
00:51:57.079 the impermanence I'm just noticing oh I
00:52:00.760 think that was the wait that was the
00:52:02.480 imprim
00:52:03.480 column as in I'm pretty sure it was the
00:52:06.280 same impermanence column did we use
00:52:09.319 regain draw effects yeah it was the same
00:52:11.599 column as the again right but we haven't
00:52:14.079 used any of the effects I think so just
00:52:15.960 let's keep that in mind I think yeah
00:52:18.319 right just as a yeah okay uh just just
00:52:22.599 to remind I guess as us if it ever
00:52:25.040 happen but I don't think we threw a car
00:52:26.520 right no I'm not sure that we actually
00:52:28.920 recycled anything cuz we only uh did we
00:52:30.960 recycle a car cuz we only have one
00:52:32.160 banish monster although we summoned what
00:52:35.680 was it two Beast steals one of them was
00:52:36.920 link kuo one of them was the
00:52:42.400 quem I think it should be okay right
00:52:44.400 because they didn't I mean same column
00:52:47.079 but uh yeah I don't think they were used
00:52:49.839 no so for now all good yeah that's good
00:52:53.119 yeah that's good um so yeah 5,000 damage
00:52:55.640 has been dealt here uh linking away the
00:52:58.359 Nibiru and the scarlight red dragon Arch
00:53:00.280 fiend doesn't need to use the uh effect
00:53:02.880 to burn here cuz we've done 3,000 in the
00:53:04.680 battle phase linking away into SP little
00:53:06.319 n remember we talked about that
00:53:07.559 incredible Synergy with Baron and the
00:53:09.799 SP absolutely and with just two minutes
00:53:12.839 remaining this is uh quite a
00:53:15.359 tough field to break and then deal
00:53:18.839 damage wow we haven't used a single
00:53:21.040 runic card by the way just to remember
00:53:23.200 so uh you know Swiss Army of a deck can
00:53:25.799 do anything I suppose normal summoning
00:53:27.440 hydrant and Anthony has 1 minute 30
00:53:30.240 seconds to deal with SP regained Baron
00:53:34.079 and make 3,000 damage just to tie this
00:53:36.760 up regain is going to resolve here on
00:53:38.640 the summit of a monster specials out the
00:53:40.359 Drews worm from the graveyard and now
00:53:42.920 we're going to activate hydrant will
00:53:44.200 Josh negate and Destroy This do we hold
00:53:45.960 here we're going to think for just a
00:53:47.280 moment here will make sense to negate
00:53:49.160 right cuz you know that there's a spell
00:53:50.680 in Anthony's
00:53:54.160 hand all right so Baron negate yeah
00:53:58.160 negating destroy the hydrant does is
00:53:59.559 there anything else from activate
00:54:01.839 turbulence in the hand okay but the time
00:54:04.960 is oh my God one minut remaining time is
00:54:07.319 ticking time is ticking we're banishing
00:54:08.559 two here special summoning turbulance on
00:54:10.680 what an ending we could use the little
00:54:14.119 Knight here no okay we're going to let
00:54:16.040 that hit the field here and now we're
00:54:17.920 going to Reborn the turbulence it looks
00:54:19.640 like there a response from
00:54:22.640 Joshua seems like the little KN will be
00:54:25.240 we are definitely going to have to use
00:54:26.280 little Knight here activates little
00:54:27.599 Knight banishing itself and the
00:54:29.680 turbulence a second turbulence hits the
00:54:31.319 field t with 30 seconds left on the
00:54:32.920 clock it doesn't matter if you can set
00:54:34.359 27 cards from the deck here we need to
00:54:36.319 do 3,000 damage one more card what is it
00:54:40.599 falls off the sinful engine do we have
00:54:43.040 anything else here that's a preventer
00:54:44.799 from the hand here that we are banishing
00:54:46.599 to special summon hits the board can we
00:54:48.839 deal anything 3,000 remember four cards
00:54:51.839 being set from the deck here 10 seconds
00:54:53.440 left 12 seconds 11 seconds 10 not 10
00:54:58.640 seconds and Anthony playing at lightning
00:55:01.040 speed even at 8 minutes he recognized
00:55:02.839 that this was going to be a long duel
00:55:04.240 and was playing at supic speed but and
00:55:07.799 like time might seconds left any seconds
00:55:11.240 now 5,000 life points Josh on 8K and
00:55:16.040 here we've got two bodies on the field
00:55:17.599 setting off the turbulence did we
00:55:19.160 resolve the turbulence yet yes we did we
00:55:21.280 did but only one target was left so now
00:55:24.079 again moments way he's just trying to
00:55:26.359 figure out what he has he has eow can he
00:55:28.520 even bring anything back scarlight is
00:55:31.119 dark okay uh confirmation from the
00:55:34.079 judges uh time has been called pH one
00:55:37.280 there is no error on your screen this is
00:55:39.720 this is it this we need to do 3,000
00:55:41.720 damage in the main phase
00:55:43.720 um do do we have it how how yeah it
00:55:47.960 seems like he just uh a matter of
00:55:49.920 moments and Joshua might have pulled
00:55:51.799 this one off cuz there is no battle
00:55:53.760 phase for and Anthony
00:55:57.520 wow okay uh making some link plays here
00:56:02.640 what can we possibly commit to 3,000
00:56:04.720 damage like I think he's just realizing
00:56:07.359 what's going on and unfortunately can't
00:56:09.119 blame him unless there is uh Sam up his
00:56:12.799 leave really considering all of these
00:56:14.559 lines but final like chance here this is
00:56:18.200 the this is the end of the it's the main
00:56:20.640 phase like what can we do like we're
