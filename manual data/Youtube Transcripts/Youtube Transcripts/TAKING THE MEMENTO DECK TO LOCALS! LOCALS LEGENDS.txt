02:07:47.559 normal yeah battle GG bro oh yeah game
02:07:52.079 good game all right guys uh this is what
02:07:54.480 I played today at locals went X1 not too
02:07:56.880 bad still learning the deck making some
02:07:58.360 misplays here and there but still
02:08:00.199 learning the deck I think the deck is
02:08:01.559 actually pretty solid uh it reminds like
02:08:05.400 I like Fusion decks I like the fact that
02:08:06.840 has Fusion plays uh it has like a boss
02:08:09.920 monster that's not like you know that's
02:08:11.440 not in the extra deck I thought that
02:08:12.639 sick I think deck is really cool I'm
02:08:14.679 looking forward to new support but just
02:08:16.639 wanted to give the deck a try so here
02:08:19.400 here's the list 40 cards clean uh um
02:08:22.320 three dark blades uh three anguish these
02:08:24.639 are all the One card starters of the
02:08:27.040 deck so dark blad is really good uh
02:08:30.320 because it forces out back row too and
02:08:32.559 these are all the one girl
02:08:34.320 starters uh three
02:08:37.599 seahorse uh this card is like one of the
02:08:39.719 best extenders in the deck in case these
02:08:41.199 gets imperm so you play them and this
02:08:43.199 card does like it does do combo it's not
02:08:45.199 the best but it still does combo by
02:08:47.199 itself then you play like uh one gatic
02:08:49.920 one Goblin one tryhorn one mace and then
02:08:53.239 one chisan maybe if this that gets a
02:08:55.920 little bit more popular you might want
02:08:57.040 to play a second one of this to play on
02:08:58.840 DD Crow but most of the time in the
02:09:00.880 combo lines you search it and you keep
02:09:02.520 it in your hand and you summon him from
02:09:04.440 The Hand by shuffling five so like
02:09:06.800 discard in theory doesn't actually get
02:09:08.360 DD crow that often so I think one is
02:09:09.960 honestly fine and then yeah that's the
02:09:12.239 deck and then that's like the main
02:09:14.960 engine that it's not that many and then
02:09:17.119 you play three Prosperity cu the deck
02:09:18.639 doesn't really need this extra Deck
02:09:23.119 um uh three bone party this card is
02:09:25.559 crazy it's like 30 bucks right now for
02:09:27.159 no reason but uh this C is basically
02:09:29.159 emergency teleport for the archetype uh
02:09:31.840 but you have to destroy a momental
02:09:32.920 monster it's really good because it
02:09:34.639 helps you like Dodge imps on like these
02:09:36.599 type of cars and then if you open like
02:09:38.559 angwi plus bone party you can play
02:09:40.119 around nib uh so uh it's just like
02:09:43.079 really strong and also the graveyard
02:09:45.159 effect you can banish it to make it so
02:09:46.920 that the creation can Pierce so 5K
02:09:49.679 piercing all your opponent's cars are in
02:09:52.480 and then three momental fusion this card
02:09:55.159 is also crazy uh like if you hard draw
02:09:57.480 any of these you can play around nib uh
02:09:59.760 and play through more hand traps so
02:10:01.040 that's why these cards are really good
02:10:02.119 this card is a main phase
02:10:04.960 polymerization uh similar to pandemonium
02:10:07.360 and if you destroy a momental monster
02:10:08.840 you can actually Shuffle the resources
02:10:10.760 from your grave to make uh fusion
02:10:12.880 monsters that's actually really crazy
02:10:15.000 because um if you play like uh there's
02:10:18.719 like the Chimera Fusion 2 you can
02:10:20.520 actually make the Chima Fusion off this
02:10:21.920 as well Shuffle back your resources and
02:10:24.040 make this card so yeah this car is like
02:10:25.760 absolutely nuts and the graveyard effect
02:10:28.000 uh is also busted because you can banish
02:10:29.719 this pop any monster you control it
02:10:31.760 doesn't have to be a mental monster and
02:10:33.079 then add any momental uh spell tra from
02:10:35.400 your deck including itself so you can
02:10:37.280 actually add like if you activate this
02:10:39.239 you can banish it to like add another
02:10:40.599 copy of itself so it's like crazy broken
02:10:42.920 and then you play one F spell cuz it's
02:10:44.199 searchable but you don't really want to
02:10:45.440 Brick on it it's usually search in your
02:10:47.239 combo lines uh it but this car is really
02:10:49.559 crazy cuz it recycles back your traps
02:10:50.960 and every every end phase um and then um
02:10:55.920 and then yeah so like basically like
02:10:57.159 even if they pop your trap you can
02:10:58.239 always use this to reset it so it's like
02:10:59.559 really annoying for your opponent and
02:11:01.159 then you play one of the Trap which is
02:11:02.480 the
02:11:05.599 APPA
02:11:07.760 okay then I played one call byther grave
02:11:10.679 uh cuz just strong on engine and then I
02:11:13.840 played 15 hand
02:11:15.159 traps so
02:11:18.040 three Ash three mlet three B
02:11:22.480 three in perm and then three
02:11:24.480 Neu um handra format what can you
02:11:29.559 do uh this deck isn't really good at
02:11:32.040 breaking boards I feel like so you want
02:11:33.559 to just kind of like stun your opponent
02:11:35.480 and then just play from there
02:11:37.199 so
02:11:40.559 yeah uh for the EXT for the side I
02:11:43.040 played three ghost ogre and then three
02:11:45.000 DD Pro just more hand traps I think
02:11:47.639 these could have been Bells as well uh I
02:11:50.000 decided I wanted to try this card out I
02:11:52.079 didn't side it just like for lab mainly
02:11:54.480 but I just wanted to try it out but this
02:11:56.159 card is in theory is also really good
02:11:57.599 against um like runic decks and runic
02:12:00.599 sun decks so I just want I wanted to try
02:12:02.639 I think this card is also really broken
02:12:04.360 some matchups you actually want this
02:12:06.840 card um
02:12:08.840 over you actually want this card over
02:12:11.040 like the appoa like when you play
02:12:12.800 against leorn because the The Continuous
02:12:15.679 trap only negates uh this card only
02:12:18.079 negates monster effects on the field um
02:12:20.679 this card is like better because against
02:12:23.079 like LNS like I just played like in the
02:12:25.360 last round you want to like popular
02:12:27.079 monsters and I played against like uh uh
02:12:30.040 what's the deck that like swarms black
02:12:32.040 wings I played against black wings as
02:12:33.280 well like this was just better in like
02:12:34.960 the Blackwing match up for example like
02:12:37.159 blackout just so crazy Three cross out
02:12:40.320 two Talons it's just for the side
02:12:42.079 pattern uh when you go first I just
02:12:44.320 wanted these card to push the combo
02:12:45.920 through and then I just wanted to try
02:12:47.480 three even match uh as back removal
02:12:51.199 could have been two storm duster as well
02:12:53.400 but I thought e is really brok in this
02:12:54.679 format so I just wanted to try
02:12:58.159 it
02:13:01.159 um all right so for the extra deck uh I
02:13:05.159 play Dark charmer uh I play two
02:13:10.559 SPS um double SP because you make it in
02:13:14.760 your turn one combo you want a second
02:13:16.320 one for the crackback so having two is
02:13:18.079 really
02:13:18.960 solid um
02:13:22.239 uh Seline uh because you can bring back
02:13:24.199 the
02:13:26.320 angwi
02:13:30.040 uh axis code to
02:13:33.280 otk AA to otk your opponent while being
02:13:38.040 protected uh this car is really good
02:13:40.559 lizardos when you nib your opponent you
02:13:43.159 want to be able to uh normal summon
02:13:46.639 something and then turn into this and
02:13:48.119 then draw a free card and then special
02:13:49.960 summon the
02:13:51.960 summ in the tatun noo so this card let
02:13:54.480 you do that so it's really
02:13:56.320 solid one cross sheep to help you climb
02:13:59.520 into AIS
02:14:01.239 code um but this car is really good
02:14:03.840 because sometimes you need to bring back
02:14:05.199 the level ones and stuff so crossi also
02:14:07.119 do
02:14:08.480 that uh let
02:14:12.719 see um I played one guarding
02:14:16.360 Chimera and then two of the Twin Dragon
02:14:21.679 uh one case
02:14:23.639 Angel uh one
02:14:25.679 tyon Sip masarina and then and then uh
02:14:30.599 one underworld goddess and that's pretty
02:14:32.159 much the
02:14:33.760 day all right guys now
