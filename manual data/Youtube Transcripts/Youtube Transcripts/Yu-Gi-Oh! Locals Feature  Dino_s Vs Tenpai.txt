00:09:48.720 that just says all all fire drag got it
00:10:00.720 I'll Attack this
00:10:05.360 [Music]
00:10:06.600 one on attack
00:10:08.880 deck
00:10:10.920 just
00:10:13.839 sure so for the effects I haven't really
00:10:17.360 played against this deck that much
00:10:19.800 they're all soft ones for Choice yeah so
00:10:22.519 as long as
00:10:26.530 [Music]
00:10:31.240 all right let me see what's on the
00:10:32.800 bottom that's why people do that okay I
00:10:35.240 never actually read all the
00:10:37.720 cards effect on Su Target
00:10:44.800 Green Oh that's
00:11:02.519 so you taking 30
00:11:07.280 [Music]
00:11:53.639 this one has
00:11:55.600 attack attack
00:11:59.880 start of damage
00:12:02.440 effect it's just this one's effect yep
00:12:05.760 start of damage or or when it's normal
00:12:07.680 or special Target level four or lower
00:12:09.720 fire something there
00:12:12.360 got that here attack three times now
00:12:16.760 Attack start or
00:12:22.480 effect why do you have to
00:12:25.240 attack so I have to attack three or more
00:12:27.560 times to get their bonus effects all
00:12:29.360 right so I'm just just a source of habit
00:12:31.800 in case in case I don't attack enough
00:12:34.279 time or something like
00:12:41.480 that so when he's summoned everything
00:12:43.680 switches to attack and you cannot
00:12:45.480 activate cards or effects in the
00:12:55.959 back C now
00:13:00.160 38 and 35 is crazy
00:13:14.440 um so this card is when it's just
00:13:17.320 destroyed yeah but I
00:13:22.160 can't well if you get rid of that then
00:13:24.240 that's a different
00:13:27.279 story you had it yeah you have to get
00:13:29.480 Sinker away the other ones now they can
00:13:31.240 die by battle okay oh it's not it's not
00:13:42.360 bad oh that's why
00:14:05.600 oh okay those are separate
00:14:07.399 effects what the effect that to summon
00:14:11.600 itself back and then when it
00:14:13.920 summon two different
00:14:21.480 effects effect on summon mhm
00:14:37.519 pop field
00:14:38.759 spell pop something
00:14:41.000 else field spell for sure
00:14:44.839 M that's the only way you get over
00:14:48.560 them and and and
00:14:52.399 um okay and is his effect in battle
00:14:56.079 phase only if he Synchro Summon what do
00:14:58.600 you mean
00:14:59.639 no no it's just whenever three or more
00:15:01.639 attacks are declared some no no not that
00:15:03.360 effect
00:15:04.399 but saying I can't activate nothing in B
00:15:06.880 oh no that's just when he's on okay so
00:15:10.120 um one field spell Target Chan

00:15:15.079 to I'll Target to
00:15:17.560 destroy yep so I can't activate
