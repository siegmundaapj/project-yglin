# What I Hate About Yu-Gi-Oh.....
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/s6szkQiAVYg

00:00:00.040 Yu-Gi-Oh is an incredible game and I've
00:00:01.959 been playing for almost 20 years at this
00:00:03.639 point I'm drawn to its balanced
00:00:05.319 complexity and Limitless options and
00:00:07.560 despite the hundreds of little things
00:00:08.760 you can do differently in each game
00:00:10.559 every small action makes a difference
00:00:12.440 and often times skillful choices will
00:00:14.200 prevail a lack of barriers and deck
00:00:15.719 construction will also let creativity
00:00:17.520 flourish and innovators are frequently
00:00:19.520 rewarded all of these things combined
00:00:21.480 are a mere fraction of the elements in
00:00:23.199 Yu-Gi-Oh that I love but there's one
00:00:25.480 thing in Yu-Gi-Oh that I absolutely
00:00:27.400 detest in Yu-Gi-Oh the way you interact
00:00:29.400 with your opponent can be classified
00:00:30.880 into three categories a removal effect
00:00:33.440 that'll kill your opponent's monsters a
00:00:35.200 negation effect that'll stop your
00:00:36.480 opponent's abilities or flued effect
00:00:38.800 that'll restrict the actions your
00:00:39.920 opponent is allowed to make as of late
00:00:41.559 the U Community has been ring against
00:00:43.079 negates and with the Banning of Baron
00:00:44.719 Defoor and Bor Savage dragon it seems
00:00:46.800 like we are trending to our future with
00:00:48.520 a lot less of these type of abilities
00:00:50.360 while an abundance in NE gates in the
00:00:51.520 game creates an unfun environment this
00:00:53.199 isn't my biggest problem with the game
00:00:54.760 FL Gates a whole other form of interrupt
00:00:56.480 the community has been crusading against
00:00:58.719 has a specific subset within the
00:01:00.519 classification that is truly the scourge
00:01:02.920 of this game lingering floodgates a type
00:01:05.680 of effect that restricts the opponent's
00:01:07.400 actions for a set amount of time these
00:01:09.280 cards activate their effects and then
00:01:10.680 cannot be interacted with for the
00:01:12.080 duration of the Restriction this means
00:01:13.880 if a lingering flate is a monster and
00:01:16.000 you'd use its ability but then is later
00:01:17.960 killed in battle or by card effects the
00:01:20.159 Restriction still applies it does not go
00:01:22.040 away it is in place the entirety of the
00:01:24.720 duration that it lists and I think that
00:01:27.159 is just ridiculous so this isn't
00:01:29.400 something that's been away from the
00:01:30.920 public eye people have talked about
00:01:32.680 these cards quite a bit and many have
00:01:35.000 been banned but I still think there are
00:01:36.960 a lot of criminal cards the game would
00:01:39.280 be a lot better without existing some
00:01:41.119 very big common ones you may see in
00:01:42.680 Yu-Gi-Oh right now are cards like
00:01:44.159 dimensional barrier Dimension shifter
00:01:46.479 Joel and lock bird how about hot red
00:01:48.439 dragon Archer fiend King Calamity that
00:01:50.600 one's a gun twister but also terrible or
00:01:52.799 gimmick puppet nightmare if you sat
00:01:54.520 acrossing these cards in the last bit
00:01:56.119 you've probably been pretty frustrated
00:01:58.280 and if you're not playing TCG well masle
00:02:00.560 has more of them you could have been Max
00:02:02.960 seed you could have been red rebooted
00:02:04.719 you could have been artifact scythed
00:02:06.240 none of these cards are fun to play
00:02:07.759 against and I don't get it because in
00:02:10.038 many cases these cards have such very
00:02:12.959 limited counterplay the ability to
00:02:15.239 interact with them is so little a card
00:02:17.400 like dimensional barrier is so hard for
00:02:18.959 you to play around because if you go
00:02:20.879 second and your opponent flips it on you
00:02:22.640 and your deck is mono Synchro mono xed
00:02:25.239 or mono Fusion or as mono ritual as well
00:02:27.840 you have almost nothing you could in
00:02:30.280 other Floodgate cases like a summon
00:02:32.599 limit or antis spell fragrance or skill
00:02:34.519 drain which I'm not really advocating
00:02:35.800 for either here but I still think
00:02:36.760 they're better than these cards Bing
00:02:38.200 anti spell fragrance you could have back
00:02:40.159 removal like lightning storm like
00:02:41.480 Harvey's feather duster that'll kill the
00:02:43.480 the flates and you'll get past it no
00:02:45.400 problem part of the problem in the past
00:02:47.640 was backing those fugates up when the
00:02:49.040 gates meant that wasn't a viable
00:02:50.360 strategy but if the gates aren going to
00:02:51.319 be in the game as much then that's not a
00:02:52.959 big of a problem however a card that
00:02:55.000 doesn't need to stay on the field means
00:02:57.599 those don't work and in many cases is
00:03:00.000 the cards that exist in these plugged
00:03:01.360 forms don't have a lot of pre-existing
00:03:03.239 ways that you can interact with them now
00:03:05.840 some cards have some intera ability and
00:03:09.200 that is the only merits to a card like
00:03:11.200 giv pop a nightmare existing is that
00:03:13.000 there are so many moving pieces in the
00:03:14.360 desia combo to resolve nightmare that
00:03:16.720 maybe it is justifiable and there's
00:03:18.799 enough counterplay against it that it's
00:03:20.440 worth doing but again go back to
00:03:22.360 Dimension barrier or Dimension shift
00:03:23.799 there those come down either in your
00:03:25.400 draw phase on on turn one or turn two
00:03:28.239 the the amount of cards that can to that
00:03:30.360 are close to zero uh it's it's not many
00:03:34.120 you guys tell me how many ways to beat
00:03:35.360 barrier or shifter or there are I I I'd
00:03:37.400 be surprised if you come up with over 10
00:03:39.120 uh let alone like three viable ones like
00:03:41.959 call by and cross out are like the
00:03:44.239 extent those don't feel good if your
00:03:46.120 neck his weaknesses to cards you have to
00:03:47.560 put cards in for cross out just to stay
00:03:49.159 alive that's that's not great but it's
00:03:52.519 something I guess the thing is here
00:03:54.439 shutting off an entire Avenue of play in
00:03:56.760 a turn is only big if Konami designs
00:03:59.439 deck
00:04:00.360 that only take one Avenue of play but it
00:04:02.799 happens to be the case very often you
00:04:05.400 know I guess could be a whole other
00:04:07.159 design Point Konami may have to look at
00:04:08.920 in the future but I think it' be a lot
00:04:10.519 easier just to remove these cards that
00:04:12.079 are overbearingly restrictive from the
00:04:13.879 game in general dimensional barrier is
00:04:16.160 obviously one of the worst offenders in
00:04:18.040 this case because being a trap card is
00:04:20.160 probably the least interactable out of
00:04:21.560 all of them as well as shutting off an
00:04:22.960 entire summoning type and effect for the
00:04:24.680 whole turn means that entire archetypes
00:04:27.280 crumble especially when some of the
00:04:29.039 restrictions come has been giving to
00:04:30.440 decks is locking them into their extra
00:04:32.680 deck summoning method for the turn which
00:04:34.680 like I get you want to stop them from
00:04:36.680 being these crazy combo decks but then
00:04:38.680 why does a card like this exist that now
00:04:40.639 gives silver bullets to every single
00:04:43.120 deck to counter yours and not just like
00:04:45.120 silver bullets that now you have to
00:04:46.280 prepare for silver buets you can't do
00:04:48.120 anything about cardic dimensional
00:04:49.759 barrier are so bad that it is the reason
00:04:52.479 I almost never play a deck that is weak
00:04:54.440 to dimensional barrier but dimensional
00:04:55.960 barrier isn't alone another big one that
00:04:57.720 I really hate and I guess it's a little
00:04:59.479 more interactable is a abys dweller a
00:05:01.440 card I've ranted about Non-Stop and this
00:05:03.560 one appeals more to me because
00:05:05.120 thankfully it's people don't always play
00:05:06.919 it that much and two level four monsters
00:05:08.400 being required for summon to make it not
00:05:10.199 as generic as something like dimensional
00:05:11.680 barrier but a someone who enjoys combo
00:05:13.400 decks and graveyard based decks staring
00:05:15.240 down this is a pain in the ass because
00:05:18.199 you still can't interact with it that
00:05:19.880 easily you can only interact with it
00:05:21.720 with quickplay spells so you were
00:05:23.280 limited to I guess now metal tronis but
00:05:25.240 before forbidden chalice and forbidden
00:05:27.479 droplet and then maybe there's some
00:05:29.680 counter play mind games with infinite
00:05:30.919 impermanence versus Kaiju where you
00:05:32.440 could try get them with those though
00:05:33.759 neither were foolproof plans and usually
00:05:35.360 weren't worth the spot playing because
00:05:37.000 they weren't foolproof and given that
00:05:38.440 you just had so few options there was
00:05:40.639 still a decent chance that the dweller
00:05:42.960 would resolve against you and if your
00:05:44.440 deck needed graveyard effects which is a
00:05:46.680 lot of decks you just couldn't do
00:05:49.680 anything there's that finals where got
00:05:51.680 dwelled four times in a row it's sucks
00:05:54.319 man it sucks and now tier was powerful
00:05:57.759 enough that there were other way ways to
00:06:00.000 play outside of the Grave which sounds
00:06:01.400 crazy as a tier player but it was true I
00:06:04.680 would rather play without a graveyard in
00:06:06.560 elements than Unchained my biggest fear
00:06:08.440 playing Unchained after the release of
00:06:09.800 rescue Ace was now there was a viable
00:06:11.240 deck that could abyss dweller me and now
00:06:13.160 I felt like despite my deck seemingly
00:06:14.880 have a good match up in most regards if
00:06:16.840 I went second and they knew to dweller
00:06:18.120 me I was just boned and that was a big
00:06:20.680 turnoff for the end half of 2023 for me
00:06:23.919 I felt the rescue a Unchained matchup
00:06:25.800 was pretty favorable to Unchained if it
00:06:27.479 wasn't in dweller but the second dweller
00:06:29.240 is put into equation it feels 50/50 but
00:06:33.720 the thing to note here is on the topic
00:06:35.400 of dweller people have stopped talking
00:06:37.639 about it you know go back to tier format
00:06:39.759 and this card was on people's radar as a
00:06:42.199 card that could potentially get banned
00:06:43.639 because its overbearing presence on that
00:06:46.080 format was very noticeable and while in
00:06:48.599 specifically tier format it's arguable
00:06:50.120 that it kept it in check and was
00:06:51.240 actually healthy for the game in most
00:06:53.160 cases that's not going to be the case
00:06:54.960 tier was the exception because it was so
00:06:56.800 ridiculously powerful that it could
00:06:58.879 bypass the overbearing effect that you
00:07:01.840 couldn't use your graveyard despite
00:07:03.080 graveyard being the main aspect of two
00:07:04.840 elements and I think a call like this
00:07:06.960 existing will just keep popping up from
00:07:08.879 format to format being something that is
00:07:11.160 very much a problem we've seen dweller
00:07:13.720 pop up time and time again as something
00:07:15.599 that is not fun to play against if you
00:07:17.520 were salad versus orcust this was like a
00:07:19.440 defining card in the match up in 2019
00:07:22.080 that was really not easy to deal with
00:07:24.080 and you had limited ability to play
00:07:26.160 around that it begs the question why
00:07:28.560 does this card need to exist there could
00:07:30.639 be something better than that I'd rather
00:07:32.639 there was graveyard removal rather Parts
00:07:35.360 like melodia sha are really cool they
00:07:37.199 can be crippling to graveyard decks but
00:07:39.160 if your opponent is able to layer their
00:07:41.000 plays effectively they could maneuver
00:07:43.199 around something like shua or like DD
00:07:44.759 quow or Bal but dweller is just blanket
00:07:47.680 you have nowhere to go you can't attack
00:07:49.479 over it first and then play main Phase 2
00:07:51.759 you can't try and force it out and then
00:07:54.879 play afterwards you really just need to
00:07:58.199 draw in your opening six the answer to
00:08:00.680 it and the problem here is that these
00:08:02.840 exist for several different functions in
00:08:05.240 Yu-Gi-Oh and they all need to go
00:08:07.720 artifact Lancia is another example of a
00:08:10.159 lingering Floodgate that says you cannot
00:08:12.199 banish for the turn and like shifter
00:08:15.039 it's almost no counterplay you need call
00:08:17.240 by the grave and that's almost it in
00:08:19.479 terms of how you can stop it and though
00:08:21.360 we don't see right now a big banish deck
00:08:23.639 imagine if every single card in your
00:08:25.360 deck has a cost required you to banish
00:08:27.240 like the top card of your deck face down
00:08:28.919 would that deck just be unplayable or
00:08:30.720 would that deck automatically just have
00:08:32.240 like a 33% loss Factor anytime this card
00:08:35.519 was being played against them or an
00:08:37.080 opponent's deck it's almost like the ash
00:08:39.240 banded Fusion thing except more real
00:08:41.200 because you have no counterplay now
00:08:42.760 Konami could design Decks that don't
00:08:44.760 have weaknesses to the lingering
00:08:46.399 floodgates that exist but that's almost
00:08:48.560 impossible considering those lingering
00:08:49.839 floodgates for almost every aspect even
00:08:52.880 link summoning now has simil archin
00:08:54.880 which is pretty specific in what it does
00:08:57.760 so it hasn't been a problem yet it's not
00:09:00.160 very future proof there cards that stop
00:09:01.880 graveyard like Dimension shifter
00:09:03.440 different dimension ground silent
00:09:04.920 graveyard there cards that stop extra
00:09:07.240 deck like dimensional barrier as well
00:09:09.279 there's cards that stop all effects
00:09:11.440 period like Calamity all summoning
00:09:13.240 period like gimi puppet cards that stop
00:09:15.399 searching like droll and mistaken arrest
00:09:17.480 this card is without banishing like
00:09:18.760 artifact Lancia there's just so many
00:09:21.279 it's likely it took the effect of
00:09:22.839 threatening Roar and said okay sure
00:09:24.480 battle pH isn't too important in
00:09:25.480 Yu-Gi-Oh let's make threatening Roar
00:09:26.920 good and make it stop everything else
00:09:28.680 and that's what all these other cards
00:09:29.760 are and uh I I just don't see the reason
00:09:32.240 why it it should persist and while we
00:09:35.279 have cards on the balance that clearly
00:09:37.360 have lingering flug effects Konami has
00:09:39.720 also kind of been going in the opposite
00:09:40.920 direction with his last ban list so
00:09:43.320 eight cards currently are banned in the
00:09:44.839 TCG with linging flate effects I already
00:09:47.000 talked about artifact scythe and Maxi
00:09:48.480 being some because those are still legal
00:09:50.120 in mle same with red reboot cold wave is
00:09:52.480 another one that is Ban utopic SXL which
00:09:55.760 couldn't interact with as I thought one
00:09:57.320 of the dumbest one ever is because it
00:09:58.440 just happened that one didn't even
00:09:59.399 activator just said ha you lose true
00:10:01.160 king of all calamities who doesn't love
00:10:03.120 the card that says you can't play the
00:10:04.480 game and shockmaster another card that
00:10:06.560 is just awesome and then one card was
00:10:10.200 banned and just came back and then is
00:10:11.959 arch nemesis protos and while I'm
00:10:13.640 ranting about dweller needing get banned
00:10:14.959 and all that this card is kind of what
00:10:16.760 launched me off into this tangent cuz
00:10:18.880 now this has come off the list if you're
00:10:20.519 not familiar with protus let me give you
00:10:21.920 a quick rundown you summon Up ab
00:10:23.120 banishing Three Monsters with different
00:10:24.320 attributes from your grave interf face
00:10:25.519 of fields it cannot be show by card
00:10:27.279 effects and then once return you can
00:10:28.800 declare monster stretch between the
00:10:29.720 field to destroy all monsters on the
00:10:30.800 field with that attribute and then
00:10:32.040 here's a kicker also until the end of
00:10:33.959 the next turn so not even this turn next
00:10:35.839 turn neither play special Z monsters
00:10:37.639 that attribute ah once it resolves
00:10:40.160 you're boned if your deck is limited to
00:10:41.560 one attribute which is like so many
00:10:43.480 decks so how is Konami supposed to plan
00:10:45.320 around building archetype it's limited
00:10:47.120 to a single attribute right like that's
00:10:48.480 not going to happen for every single
00:10:49.399 attribute so every every single deck
00:10:51.040 that's mono attribute now will have a
00:10:52.240 weakness to this card in the future as
00:10:54.079 long as it's still unbanned you may say
00:10:55.800 okay it's at one why is this the problem
00:10:57.760 well it's searchable you can search it
00:10:59.800 with Nemesis flag meaning flag is
00:11:02.200 searchable via bonfire versus Sprint and
00:11:04.760 then promethian princess getting it back
00:11:06.000 which not too hard uh you can get it off
00:11:07.959 of Banshee getting a flag you can also
00:11:09.880 go sword Soul chesa which gets sword
00:11:11.399 Soul emergence which gets Rus point
00:11:13.680 being when you want to get this card it
00:11:15.639 is fairly easy to do so and while it
00:11:18.240 might not see play at the very moment
00:11:20.120 with Yu-Gi-Oh and as a deck builder you
00:11:21.639 always want to be very forward thinking
00:11:23.440 thinking into the potential of the
00:11:24.600 future and as someone who's not a huge
00:11:27.160 fan of hand trap formats I'm looking to
00:11:28.880 a future the game where I can return to
00:11:30.279 playing High engine counts and relying
00:11:32.680 on the cards in my archetype to be
00:11:34.760 problem solving and to play through FS
00:11:36.880 most decks won't have an in-house
00:11:38.480 ability to beat lingering floodgates so
00:11:40.480 if I'm getting Proto it kind of tells me
00:11:42.959 like maybe the way that I I love playing
00:11:45.320 Yu-Gi-Oh just will always be invalidated
00:11:47.279 now protos won't always exist in the
00:11:48.680 game and won't always be a viable option
00:11:50.360 which is like some help but there's just
00:11:52.040 so many lingering flates that it's kind
00:11:53.639 of concerning that while these I'm to
00:11:56.240 get banned so do these and now one of
00:11:58.200 the fun things about Proto here uh is we
00:12:00.040 can talk about how the monster versions
00:12:01.880 of the Moon flaggots are maybe a little
00:12:03.120 more manageable cuz there are more
00:12:04.160 interaction points with them protos is
00:12:06.079 used on the prior turn so unlike
00:12:08.440 something like King Calamity or the
00:12:10.720 albon sanctifier and the puppet
00:12:11.920 nightmare play which you can interact
00:12:13.240 with on the turn of happening or dweller
00:12:14.760 even you have to veiler or imperm protos
00:12:17.360 essentially because once your turn comes
00:12:20.600 it's already in effect you can't have
00:12:22.800 forbidden CH of droplet now and that's
00:12:24.519 just crazy like that's level of of
00:12:26.399 shockmaster a card that's been banned
00:12:28.720 for almost a decade at this point right
00:12:31.279 and for good reason cuz like if by that
00:12:33.399 logic protos is okay to exist
00:12:35.000 shockmaster which is similar and
00:12:36.279 requiring a bit of setup to make but
00:12:38.199 albeit makeable and albeit somewhat
00:12:40.639 interactable that should be legal too
00:12:43.279 and please don't get this as me
00:12:44.760 advocating for shockmaster like even if
00:12:46.720 these aren't the biggest problems in
00:12:48.199 each format there will be formats where
00:12:50.240 these cards always pop up because they
00:12:51.880 maybe are too specific in what they do
00:12:53.600 but when they do pop up they're never a
00:12:55.320 good thing they're almost always for the
00:12:57.720 detriment of the health of the game and
00:12:59.720 I think Yu-Gi-Oh would be a lot better
00:13:01.279 if what is ultimately the worst part of
00:13:02.959 Yu-Gi-Oh in my opinion would just be
00:13:04.720 erased and I know this would mean a
00:13:06.800 rather large Banning for some of these
00:13:09.160 cards cards like silent graveyard which
00:13:10.800 haven't really been too playable because
00:13:12.320 there are just better Alternatives I
00:13:14.199 think that is still the right course of
00:13:15.639 action so let me know what you guys
00:13:17.120 think if there's a part of Yu-Gi-Oh that
00:13:18.480 you guys really hate I'm curious to see
00:13:20.120 as well because my fixation on combo
00:13:23.560 decks is a large reason why this
00:13:25.360 specifically is the biggest element
00:13:27.440 Yu-Gi-Oh I just like so I'm wondering if
00:13:29.519 you have a different play style if
00:13:30.600 there's different part of Yu-Gi-Oh that
00:13:32.120 you also really don't want to see and
00:13:33.880 also let me know if any of the points I
00:13:35.279 made you didn't agree with or if I
00:13:37.160 missed anything on top of those if there
00:13:39.040 any other lingering floodgates that have
00:13:40.240 really caused you a problem and I just
00:13:42.160 glanced over them or mention them at all
00:13:44.120 then share your SOB stories with me I
00:13:46.199 will be the shoulder for you to cry on
00:13:47.800 anyways if you want to see more
00:13:48.639 discussion videos about Yu-Gi-Oh in a
00:13:50.880 more broad sense then I can do that as
00:13:52.399 well just let me know with a like
00:13:53.519 subscription and a comment down below
00:13:55.399 supporting it anyways I'll see you all
00:13:56.920 next time peace
