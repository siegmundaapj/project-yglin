# https://www.youtube.com/watch/xITcjUmFFBg

00:00:01.280 yo what's up guys so uh today I just had
00:00:03.399 uh some of my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh moments
00:00:05.400 uh just playing the game uh with desia I
00:00:08.000 played a 60 card turbo variant uh huge
00:00:10.559 shouts to Luca uh for helping me with
00:00:12.559 the deck and a little bit with the
00:00:13.559 theory um and of course shout out to Sam
00:00:16.400 uh Team 7x1 uh you can check US Supreme
00:00:18.760 Pro use the sleeve and buy this playm uh
00:00:21.160 use pack 10 for 10% off I believe the
00:00:23.240 mat is almost completely sold out but
00:00:24.680 there's a bundle where you can get
00:00:25.880 Supreme Pros uh whites and the playmat
00:00:28.599 to go along with it right so
00:00:31.039 but yeah let's go right into the The
00:00:32.479 Deck Profile um so I played uh turbo Des
00:00:35.719 so I played 60 cards all gas no breaks I
00:00:38.520 felt like I broke pretty much every
00:00:40.480 board I actually chose to Blind second
00:00:42.280 at some point during the tournament
00:00:43.680 because I was like yo like let's just
00:00:45.000 limit test um but anyways um I play
00:00:47.760 three Alber um standard right three
00:00:51.199 tragedy this car is really good because
00:00:53.520 not only does it search you pieces of
00:00:54.960 engine and I play the patwork engine so
00:00:56.559 like this getting sent to the graveyard
00:00:58.239 is really good um this allows you to
00:01:00.719 reset all your Brandon spells and traps
00:01:02.480 so I like set back Randon and red so
00:01:04.280 many times it was like really really
00:01:05.519 good for me um so try was at three was
00:01:07.799 like really
00:01:09.680 good uh three Al on the uh shot of
00:01:13.560 dragon this is basically like in like a
00:01:16.119 crazy upart in the deck it uh thins out
00:01:18.680 your deck by a card and being able to
00:01:20.600 send out anything you want for this for
00:01:22.040 cost is like really
00:01:24.040 crazy uh for more despar cards you
00:01:26.600 played one at libitum uh just because uh
00:01:29.240 you want the utility searches so you can
00:01:30.640 end on Triple miror J uh three albz uh
00:01:34.759 because hard drawing this card is AR
00:01:35.840 even that bad like that I won a game
00:01:37.600 where I normal summon alas going second
00:01:39.759 um it's pretty
00:01:41.119 good uh three carasia usually want to
00:01:44.880 open as many engine cars as possible cuz
00:01:46.560 that's going to be how you beat Ash
00:01:48.040 Blossom a lot of people think you Ash
00:01:49.520 Brandon Fusion like if the game's over
00:01:51.040 but it's really not uh two qu a lot of
00:01:53.360 people play one but the second one is
00:01:54.719 really really good because it lets you
00:01:55.840 play around nib um and then having a
00:01:58.240 second copy is uh really nice because if
00:02:01.039 you start off with quem and it get
00:02:02.680 stopped you can use opening to like get
00:02:04.759 access to another one um and I think
00:02:06.240 that could be like really
00:02:08.560 useful uh three EDG chain because it's
00:02:11.319 like really good Discord fold and uh it
00:02:14.200 gets you like a lot of pluses one serer
00:02:16.720 one lbon for like the combo and then one
00:02:19.720 McCurry one giving puppet this car was
00:02:21.239 ass uh I like barely summoned this card
00:02:24.440 I think like your regular uh Brandon end
00:02:26.480 board is like good enough um like no
00:02:28.440 troll I'm probably not going to play
00:02:29.560 this card maybe I'll side it but I don't
00:02:31.040 think I'll side it because I put it in
00:02:32.640 cuz everyone was telling me like oh you
00:02:34.200 should play this you should play this
00:02:35.319 that I test it with but honestly all the
00:02:37.400 games I've played like this card never
00:02:39.040 came up the situation where like oh you
00:02:41.400 try to like play into a board and then
00:02:43.680 give me PP of them going second is fake
00:02:45.239 too because that means you had enough
00:02:47.080 cards to like probably kill them somehow
00:02:49.159 um but you decided to like give me pupp
00:02:50.360 and make the game go longer for no
00:02:51.560 reason so I think it's really fake I I
00:02:54.040 don't I really don't think you need this
00:02:55.120 card to play the game um I think the
00:02:56.840 deck is already really really strong
00:02:58.000 without it uh three brand Fusion best
00:03:00.800 card three opening uh because it gets
00:03:03.360 either quim or Alber so it's really
00:03:05.959 crazy um I did a really nice play today
00:03:09.560 where I go um I was playing under uh I
00:03:11.920 was trying to bait my opponent to flip
00:03:13.080 sum liit so I go Brandon
00:03:15.640 fusion and then my opponent goes sure
00:03:18.599 and then I went chain opening uh my
00:03:20.799 opponent uh flips some limit so that R
00:03:23.879 Fusion wouldn't resolve but they forgot
00:03:25.480 that brand opening can add the monster
00:03:26.920 to my hand instead which is what I did
00:03:28.680 and then I I just like resolve uh fusion
00:03:31.120 and just won the game so so I I beat
00:03:34.599 some that way because uh my Brandon
00:03:36.280 Fusion sent Sall dragon and then pop
00:03:38.200 this limit so pretty good uh two red
00:03:41.560 could be three to be honest pretty good
00:03:44.239 uh I won through skill drain and uh
00:03:47.680 there can only be one because of uh this
00:03:49.840 card uh Brandon loss uh I think I might
00:03:53.040 want to bump this card to three to be
00:03:54.159 honest this C won me so many games sing
00:03:56.079 handling by itself and um your opponent
00:03:58.200 not able to respond is actually unfair
00:04:00.760 uh one white because uh there are
00:04:02.200 situations where you need access to a
00:04:03.760 poly um when you already have access to
00:04:05.879 like brand Fusion so Brandon white helps
00:04:07.319 you that especially hands where you open
00:04:08.480 a lot of
00:04:09.840 albes uh three emergency teleports for
00:04:13.840 uh parasia or albz three patchworks two
00:04:17.918 polymerization you can play one poly
00:04:20.120 because this card can recycle back
00:04:23.520 polymerization uh this card uh the
00:04:26.639 Magnus but or Magnum uh but I think two
00:04:29.479 was good good like hard drawing po was
00:04:30.840 really good for me uh I play cars like
00:04:32.880 fantasma and bals so that like um I beat
00:04:36.039 like floodgates uh cuz like or not like
00:04:39.280 basically like summ limit because um I
00:04:40.800 think the de is really good right now
00:04:41.759 because it has a really good engine out
00:04:43.000 summ limit where uh I start my turn off
00:04:45.400 with fantasmi then I just go
00:04:47.280 polymerization like use an ed use a use
00:04:50.440 Ed use tragedy blow up their summon
00:04:53.720 limit they can't princess me because
00:04:55.400 Prim can't be targeted so I think this
00:04:57.199 SC is too crazy to not play and then I
00:04:59.400 play all the good the good cards that
00:05:01.680 made this deck quotequote turbo uh three
00:05:05.120 talents three thrust three droplets
00:05:08.039 three pot of greed uh three more pot of
00:05:10.840 greed and then one retribution one
00:05:13.120 Fusion dup so I think I think like uh I
00:05:16.520 think one of my games I had like 20
00:05:18.120 cards left after turn one uh so I went
00:05:20.720 through my entire deck cuz uh that's
00:05:22.720 basically what this deck is designed to
00:05:23.919 do um for the extra deck double mirror
00:05:27.520 Jade uh sanctifier
00:05:30.440 uh I barely use this summon puppet
00:05:32.560 mainly I use this card to beat evly
00:05:33.880 match against flu under like uh I use
00:05:36.400 this to beat e match and then another
00:05:37.840 cool play is that um my opponent magn me
00:05:40.639 so I used this to summon his magma then
00:05:42.400 use the magma effect to recycle back uh
00:05:45.080 on my alvan from the graveyard back to
00:05:47.360 my deck so I had uh basically infinite
00:05:49.759 resources um so I just kept suming magn
00:05:52.360 but adding back missiles and stuff like
00:05:53.560 that so this car this car is really
00:05:55.160 crazy
00:05:56.919 um two grandol um you have to play two
00:06:01.600 because uh you make one turn one and
00:06:04.520 then uh on your opponent's turn you make
00:06:06.120 another one and then you can use that to
00:06:07.720 send at libidum uh that's why I really
00:06:10.360 like two because you use one turn one to
00:06:12.199 send like albian or like uh whatever you
00:06:14.479 need like engine requirements uh like
00:06:16.680 sometimes like when you don't have
00:06:17.560 access to Brandon Fusion you can use
00:06:19.520 this card to send for
00:06:22.039 instance uh this card uh and then this
00:06:25.479 card sends brand Fusion to the graveyard
00:06:28.199 or you can use this to send serir and
00:06:30.280 then serir will dump Brandon fusion and
00:06:31.759 then you just need either the sh Dragon
00:06:34.160 to dump retribution to add back Brandon
00:06:35.840 Fusion so you actually have a lot of
00:06:37.360 wayte to get brand Fusion without ever
00:06:38.680 drawing it so uh but you need two grand
00:06:41.160 goon from sure to help that the reason
00:06:42.919 why this card is also really broken is
00:06:44.400 because I
00:06:45.479 played uh quitus and then the spice for
00:06:49.160 skin on so basically against like the
00:06:51.160 pure snake ey board uh when you start
00:06:53.319 with cortasia you automatically check
00:06:55.120 their IP mascar because uh when they
00:06:57.759 activate IP masarina you can change Asia
00:06:59.919 to summon a
00:07:01.120 grandon um and then because your
00:07:03.319 opponent special summon a monster using
00:07:04.919 a monster effect you can then go grun
00:07:07.560 effect Ching went to foolish chilling to
00:07:09.199 gr to banish Assa the S
00:07:12.199 pran um and then on a new chain uh your
00:07:15.560 opponent first of all has an SP on the
00:07:17.080 board now um and they don't have
00:07:18.680 anything good to banish so they lose
00:07:20.080 value out of their SP so they just
00:07:21.240 banish a random cation out of your
00:07:22.440 graveyard and then on resolution you
00:07:24.120 summon a pinan if they try to princess
00:07:26.319 Target your Pini to destroy it you can
00:07:28.080 chain pran to banish their princess
00:07:30.560 um another cool application of presion
00:07:32.599 is that you can make this card um and
00:07:34.800 then use it to bring back your
00:07:35.879 opponent's Baron like summon their Baron
00:07:38.000 um off for SK and then just have free om
00:07:39.840 so that's also another cool play um
00:07:42.120 which I did before cuz I was playing
00:07:43.440 against um I played against a couple
00:07:45.400 manadan players and I use sanctifier and
00:07:47.599 panian and summon back my opponent's
00:07:49.280 Baron so I have free infinite om negates
00:07:51.440 so it's just like an omate Loot and they
00:07:53.400 just can't win from
00:07:56.000 there
00:07:58.120 um uh play two albian I think you have
00:08:01.039 to play two one to summon one for the
00:08:03.120 grind uh one lelion that's all you need
00:08:05.280 recycles all your resources back uh
00:08:07.599 totin clad I didn't make this card as
00:08:09.199 much but the main reason why I played it
00:08:10.919 was because like if I ever got niw I can
00:08:13.840 uh chain mirj to send uh to Tin clad the
00:08:16.199 ash dragon and then use ash Dragon to
00:08:18.240 summon a quem for my deck then use quem
00:08:20.319 to send like an alaz or like whatever
00:08:22.080 I'm missing basically so it basically
00:08:23.840 got me access to like albz or qu at end
00:08:25.639 phase which is really really strong um
00:08:27.960 and sometimes you need a really big b
00:08:29.479 mon so this card helps you with
00:08:31.159 that
00:08:32.919 um yeah oh oh also Pinon has like a
00:08:35.640 crazy second effect that people don't
00:08:36.958 read which is like it has an effect to
00:08:38.320 like uh burn and I want a game off its
00:08:40.279 burn effect actually uh which is
00:08:41.839 actually kind of nice uh guardan Chimera
00:08:44.920 I wish I could fit two in but I can't uh
00:08:47.440 Magnum is basically baby Chimera uh but
00:08:50.080 I think it's like just as good because
00:08:51.920 this C can pop a both players turn so
00:08:53.480 you basically get two pops because you
00:08:54.959 pop in your turn and then you pop in
00:08:56.560 your opponent's turn off its quick
00:08:57.680 effect and then this car shuffles back
00:08:59.560 cards like uh Brandon Fusion uh I
00:09:02.279 believe it can even Shuffle back fusion
00:09:03.720 deployment but yeah it says one Fusion
00:09:05.839 spell Fusion deployment counts for that
00:09:07.720 so uh and then you get to draw a card so
00:09:09.959 this car is really good it's it's one of
00:09:11.399 the ways to like turbo because you go
00:09:13.720 Patchwork you you'd go like you would
00:09:16.120 summon like grun off of like uh grun off
00:09:19.600 of um uh cortasia and then you would use
00:09:23.079 like pully to make Magnum using the
00:09:25.040 gruno and the EDM uh chain and this card
00:09:27.680 draws you another card uh and then you
00:09:30.160 pop a card so and then or you can go
00:09:32.399 into Guardian CH first draw two cards
00:09:34.519 pop one then use the Chim to make a
00:09:36.440 magnum and then draw another card so
00:09:38.279 like this is basically like how you like
00:09:39.880 you're filtering through your deck um
00:09:41.959 but if so like playing magnet helps you
00:09:43.399 with that um I would play two Guardian
00:09:45.079 Comm if I could but there's just no
00:09:46.760 space one stellia for when you get
00:09:48.680 shifter um and then one Ren Brum to send
00:09:51.120 off of Mir Jade so that you have an
00:09:52.800 extra interruption in the form of bbas
00:09:54.519 because what you can do is you can use
00:09:56.519 mirj to send Ren Brum and then Ren Brum
00:09:59.399 and make sure that you don't lose to
00:10:01.240 aysal because if they try to Bisal your
00:10:03.440 albz you just change breed and red after
00:10:05.120 you win BR so it guarantees you beat
00:10:07.560 aysal uh for the side deck I played more
00:10:10.320 bals I think they're really good this
00:10:12.279 format I played one of each s is the
00:10:14.200 best one because it gets you access
00:10:15.279 engine as well uh I played one Dragon uh
00:10:18.160 which is like the tech because you can
00:10:20.000 use shadal Fusion I mean uh not shidol
00:10:21.720 Fusion but Brandon Fusion to out
00:10:22.800 floodgates uh there's a game where you I
00:10:24.480 hardre shadal dragon and then I AC
00:10:26.760 branded opening in draw phase pitch
00:10:28.560 dragon seven Alber pop his uh FL underwe
00:10:31.640 trap in draw phase um so shadal dragon
00:10:33.760 is like really good for that situation
00:10:34.920 as well so it doesn't suck to draw um
00:10:37.680 and it works really well with guarding
00:10:38.760 Chimera because Chimera doesn't Target
00:10:40.839 but shadal Dragon does so you just pick
00:10:42.880 a card with shadal dragon and then
00:10:44.920 Chimera just pops R left so like this is
00:10:47.279 how you beat some of them pretty much uh
00:10:49.399 I decid Brandon bishman because I
00:10:51.200 actually expected other desia players
00:10:53.160 and banishment helps you beat the mirror
00:10:55.720 uh cuz you super prob the whole board
00:10:56.920 and they just lose also it's really good
00:10:58.600 against voices too
00:11:00.160 uh three Cosmic flood for floods three
00:11:02.519 dark rer because if you darker the pure
00:11:04.200 s ey board the rest of the death engine
00:11:06.360 can just break it um the AL is really
00:11:09.519 difficult and three vasmi so basically
00:11:10.839 the theory is uh when they see me
00:11:12.480 playing 60 card desia they're probably
00:11:14.000 like yo this dude has no hand traps in
00:11:15.279 his deck so they should be citing out
00:11:16.800 their talents and as a result like you
00:11:18.240 never actually get punished by talents
00:11:19.440 when you fantasm your opponent um and
00:11:21.639 then the reason why fantasma is really
00:11:23.120 good is because you start your turn off
00:11:24.800 with a body cards like Patchwork can
00:11:26.839 immediately make it so that your first
00:11:28.160 summon is guard and C to wipe all their
00:11:29.839 back row which is typically like the
00:11:31.399 stuff that you can't really beat like
00:11:32.600 the stuff you can't see so um yeah
00:11:35.120 fantasmi filtered my hand and made it so
00:11:37.120 like I just drew God every time so is
00:11:39.240 crazy it's also a dragon monster um so
00:11:41.959 yeah that's
00:11:43.120 it uh don't oh also shout out to jiun
00:11:45.839 for letting me the deck uh I I robbed
00:11:48.600 him uh and I've had his deck for
00:11:50.680 probably a month now so GG's but yeah
00:11:53.639 anyways shout out to June um I would not
00:11:55.560 be playing Des without him anyways uh
00:11:57.480 that's it don't forget to check out t
00:12:00.360 thank you
