# https://www.youtube.com/watch/ovl7AKwnhXU

00:00:00.060 hey what is up guys it is my games GX
00:00:03.240 here and we are doing a live commentary
00:00:06.960 over a game from heart of the game
00:00:09.480 locals last Tuesday I want to say maybe
00:00:12.420 it was Saturday and we have pearly
00:00:15.299 versus branded Chimera I'm gonna try to
00:00:18.779 start doing these commentaries because I
00:00:21.240 think it's just going to be a better way
00:00:22.980 to do these games so let's get into it
00:00:26.220 we're going to see the brand Chimera uh
00:00:28.320 go into main phase and resolve a branded
00:00:30.599 Fusion we love to see it we love to see
00:00:32.520 no Ash see the gazelle and fall in the
00:00:34.620 elbows come down and then we are going
00:00:38.160 to then see a rinbrum come down and then
00:00:43.200 we're going to see gazelle get resolved
00:00:45.780 and we're going to see the search
00:00:48.480 obviously that's what gazelle does we
00:00:50.399 see a ghost mortar plus two super polies
00:00:52.739 in hand plus an ash too so it looks like
00:00:56.579 brand player is going to be really just
00:00:58.379 ending on this for the most part he's
00:01:00.600 going to be able to probably do his
00:01:01.800 Chimera combos obviously pearly player
00:01:04.379 is going to recodle which is
00:01:05.640 understandable and so then we're going
00:01:08.340 to see the uh search of the mirror sword
00:01:10.320 night into a special summon into a
00:01:11.760 special summon of burfamat which is
00:01:13.619 perfect match obviously going to get the
00:01:16.320 Branded or the Chimera Fusion plus a
00:01:18.540 gazelle for follow-up next turn I
00:01:20.220 believe Nick is also on
00:01:22.400 to
00:01:24.060 um gazelle I he says you you don't
00:01:26.520 really have to run three which is
00:01:27.900 totally fair you know we see different
00:01:29.400 lines of thought with the stack which I
00:01:30.900 really do think that it's in it's not a
00:01:32.939 solved act by any means and so
00:01:35.640 um camera player has a lot of cards in
00:01:37.500 hand so he isn't he's honestly in pretty
00:01:40.500 good position anyways that's the
00:01:41.880 strengths of the stack you're able to do
00:01:44.820 a lot with just one or two cards
00:01:46.799 essentially and still will run like hand
00:01:48.540 traps and such so I'm gonna see the
00:01:51.060 camera come down and that's going to get
00:01:52.740 discarded at the end phase we're going
00:01:54.360 to see a set of one super poly keeping
00:01:56.640 one super poly in hand plus the two Hand
00:01:58.259 traps
00:01:59.880 um preloaded grave too so uh we're going
00:02:02.280 to see then a discard of a regular
00:02:05.340 pearly so we obviously now know that we
00:02:07.560 are on pearly I think Brandon has
00:02:09.360 actually a pretty good pearly match up
00:02:11.400 it's I'm not sure about Chimera uh
00:02:14.520 branded but it's still pretty good
00:02:17.640 um so we are going to see a special
00:02:21.540 summon of birth I'm at um
00:02:24.959 with a chimera Fusion also
00:02:28.319 um at the end phase I believe and
00:02:32.700 then we are going to
00:02:36.420 um let the uh pearly player get into his
00:02:39.060 turn here
00:02:40.319 and big thing here
00:02:44.340 we're just gonna speed up we're going to
00:02:46.140 go into a pearly uh sleepy memory
00:02:49.200 um happy memory these cards are
00:02:51.180 backwards so here I'm gonna pause it
00:02:58.379 okay so I flipped around the video I'm
00:03:00.900 no longer a bozo so we are going to see
00:03:04.379 um a pearly uh pretty memory come down
00:03:06.420 with the book of eclipse discard
00:03:08.099 obviously going to go into a per Lily
00:03:12.319 pearly is going to get a mirror sword
00:03:15.720 night chained on him
00:03:17.940 um
00:03:19.260 which is going to because he has the
00:03:21.720 birth or I mean the camaron board so he
00:03:23.700 gets those engraveyard in the gates
00:03:25.319 through coddle and sword night which
00:03:28.019 really does add a lot to the deck it
00:03:30.000 does a lot with nothing so we're going
00:03:32.819 to see a big thing on the Pearly player
00:03:34.800 into a happy memory this time
00:03:37.620 and
00:03:39.300 we're going to see the players uh talk
00:03:42.420 about uh just a ruling and then we're
00:03:45.000 going to see oh okay I guess he was
00:03:47.220 thinking before he could play a card and
00:03:49.200 then Super poly came down and we're
00:03:52.620 going to see a starving Venom dragon
00:03:57.000 which is pretty interesting uh starving
00:03:59.819 them dragons pretty good in terms of a
00:04:01.920 super polytarget honestly if you're able
00:04:03.480 to resolve anything in this meta within
00:04:04.980 chains and stuff like that it's pretty
00:04:06.120 good
00:04:07.200 so
00:04:09.480 pearly player has three cards left to
00:04:11.400 deal with I mean tactics is gonna put in
00:04:14.040 a lot of work here so he's gonna go into
00:04:16.079 for the pretty memory which is probably
00:04:18.959 gonna go uncontested he discards the
00:04:21.720 tactics though I guess it that yeah you
00:04:24.960 know I guess it won't go very hard here
00:04:27.720 um because oh well there's the mourner
00:04:30.000 and we get the scoop for game three or
00:04:33.540 game two uh it'll be interesting to see
00:04:35.580 what they side in not gonna really go
00:04:37.979 over it too much
00:04:39.419 um just to save some time we're going to
00:04:40.979 see a draw of prosperity a trap uh or
00:04:43.860 pretty memory
00:04:45.600 um on top of another memory and I see a
00:04:47.340 d barrier too which you always love to
00:04:49.680 see I see a sleeping memory too so the
00:04:51.660 Pearly player has a lot to play with
00:04:53.340 here it just depends if we're going to
00:04:55.620 see some hand traps to stop some things
00:04:57.180 but even then the Pearly player should
00:04:58.620 be able to end on the board that uh
00:05:01.259 suffices so we're going to see pretty
00:05:03.900 memory because like Chimera in
00:05:05.759 particular might not be able to
00:05:09.479 out the Noir as easily as pure branded
00:05:12.900 so we're going to see a pre-memory
00:05:15.060 discard the Sleepy memory we don't go
00:05:17.160 for the prosperity at first we're going
00:05:18.660 to save that obviously we're gonna see a
00:05:20.880 mourner on the per Lily
00:05:23.639 marner's really going in Nick also has a
00:05:27.000 droll and they book a moon and a triple
00:05:29.820 tactics talents don't know what the
00:05:32.400 fourth card is but if it's a brand
00:05:34.680 infusion that's pretty good then we're
00:05:36.120 going to chroll on the per Lily after it
00:05:39.360 searches which is pretty harsh but I
00:05:41.699 feel like the upside to pearly is that
00:05:44.400 you're able to play through
00:05:46.320 draw pretty easily once you because all
00:05:48.780 you really need is one search I mean
00:05:50.460 it's really when you're breaking boards
00:05:52.020 that you kind of need to search out more
00:05:53.340 than anything but
00:05:54.960 um so we are going to see the
00:05:58.800 pearly player CA get big think here
00:06:02.340 looking at the slacker magician maybe
00:06:04.800 thinking about
00:06:06.060 I mean we can't do Zeus here so I'm not
00:06:08.220 really too sure what that is but we do
00:06:10.680 have the D barrier at least to turn skip
00:06:13.080 so you know it's still I I'd say very
00:06:17.100 much in
00:06:18.900 pearly players favor obviously we have
00:06:21.360 the pot he might just set here it's a
00:06:24.240 big thing
00:06:25.500 um I think he does need to end and on
00:06:28.020 some sort of board presence though I
00:06:29.400 mean he could turn skip with the barrier
00:06:31.139 I guess just do that
00:06:33.120 wow yeah
00:06:35.100 looks like that's what he's gonna do
00:06:36.600 holy crap is that correct you guys let
00:06:39.240 me know pearly players Kevin's a very
00:06:41.340 good player I know he plays a lot of
00:06:42.840 that because I'm just I'm just curious
00:06:44.400 if it was optimal or not
00:06:46.860 um we're going to see a pass by the
00:06:49.319 Branded player we don't even need the D
00:06:51.900 barrier to do that
00:06:54.240 um this is I see a Thrust as I guess was
00:06:56.759 the other card so this is the downside
00:06:58.800 to I mean like you still need to see
00:07:01.199 your engine and we're not seeing engine
00:07:03.180 here um uh Power Prosperity comes down
00:07:07.220 that I'm assuming uh pot was deactivated
00:07:10.620 last turn that's why we did not activate
00:07:12.180 it
00:07:13.800 pearly uh Prosperity it seems pretty
00:07:16.680 pretty good in it um even though
00:07:19.020 sometimes maybe it can be turned off but
00:07:20.940 we are going to see a imperme Salem
00:07:22.919 crossout
00:07:24.720 um
00:07:25.639 happy memory another Emperor we love
00:07:28.020 those ultium perm shout out to Kevin for
00:07:30.240 always having the best
00:07:32.220 looking cards
00:07:34.319 um around always going for the max
00:07:35.759 Rarity so
00:07:37.139 we are now going to see a takeover
00:07:40.039 memory uh which is interesting
00:07:43.460 so we are going to then see perlily use
00:07:47.099 it so once per turn effect which is once
00:07:49.620 per turn but we are going to then uh go
00:07:53.460 for book a moon
00:07:55.560 I'm really kind of confused here what
00:07:57.240 just happened you guys are gonna have to
00:07:58.800 let me know what just happened there
00:08:01.440 um
00:08:03.479 we are then going to
00:08:06.000 see the Sleepy memory come down oh
00:08:09.599 that's what's happening he's overlying
00:08:11.699 and big thinking got it
00:08:13.620 into the E pearly Noir I feel like
00:08:16.259 pearly is really interesting because it
00:08:18.780 was expected to be the best stock right
00:08:21.240 now it's not the best stock it's like
00:08:22.740 the fourth bus stuck at best
00:08:25.139 um
00:08:26.099 it just the this the delicious memory
00:08:30.060 hit really just destroyed the deck not
00:08:32.640 destroyed it but it still does
00:08:34.799 it's just too Fair
00:08:37.799 it doesn't do anything broken anymore
00:08:40.679 um
00:08:41.279 like you're ending on this kind of board
00:08:43.260 and he swings in and then you have to
00:08:45.959 exceed in the next turn through a trap
00:08:48.839 like I don't know like pearly seems
00:08:52.620 really good when you know how to Pilot
00:08:54.120 it but you know it's also seems very
00:08:56.640 good
00:08:57.980 inconsistent to say the least I've heard
00:09:00.240 a lot of players say that they just
00:09:01.740 don't like playing the deck not sure if
00:09:03.600 that's just the sentiment across the
00:09:05.220 board but you know I feel like that
00:09:06.540 won't be the case if delicious memories
00:09:08.040 still there and I feel like it's really
00:09:09.600 unfortunate that that got hit that soon
00:09:12.360 but you know it was a broken card to be
00:09:14.700 fair
00:09:15.720 um triple tactics thrust ultimate rare
00:09:17.760 comes down by Nick which is pretty good
00:09:20.040 it's really a guaranteed card to go off
00:09:21.839 through the Pearly player
00:09:24.360 um we are going to
00:09:28.380 get an ash on that obviously which is
00:09:30.540 pretty good but honestly if the Branded
00:09:32.279 player has the brand Fusion which he
00:09:34.800 would have used already then oh he has
00:09:37.019 the tactics though draws in to book a
00:09:40.560 moon and then the gazelle gazelle's not
00:09:42.540 bad here honestly oh it was a branded
00:09:44.940 Fusion that's huge that's huge and the D
00:09:47.339 barrier comes down though which is going
00:09:50.040 to really help out the Pearly player um
00:09:53.160 because I will come down and then get
00:09:55.260 the search
00:09:57.480 um definitely looking about a tie game
00:10:01.320 here I would not be surprised
00:10:04.860 um if this wins a game three I have not
00:10:07.680 actually checked yet this we're finding
00:10:09.779 out together folks so
00:10:12.720 we're going to see a pass by the Branded
00:10:15.060 player
00:10:16.019 um because I really can't do much then
00:10:17.339 we're going to see the Pearly get
00:10:19.560 targeted by Pokemon that's why book moon
00:10:21.180 is so good this format for that exact
00:10:22.800 interaction where you just negate the
00:10:25.080 Noir just for free and get rid of the
00:10:27.360 Trap it's just so good if the Trap was
00:10:29.100 like maybe continuous
00:10:31.019 that would be nice but like
00:10:33.360 because it's not it's just like wow
00:10:36.720 um we're going to see the field spell
00:10:38.700 come down
00:10:40.880 and
00:10:42.480 field spell is interesting obviously
00:10:44.720 fieldsville does a lot alright guys we
00:10:47.579 are back
00:10:49.019 um
00:10:50.160 getting a read of the field spell which
00:10:53.399 is really good it allows you to just
00:10:55.260 gain advantage in the end phase
00:10:58.620 which really does a lot for pearly right
00:11:00.899 now so I think like some builds were
00:11:02.579 even on the field swell before with
00:11:04.140 delicious memory right one we see the
00:11:05.700 Chimera Fusion come down using
00:11:14.240 which is going to get a discard in the
00:11:16.860 end phased way more pearly's Advantage
00:11:19.860 at the end phase obviously we
00:11:23.220 it's not looking great for the Pearly
00:11:24.779 player because if the brand player is
00:11:27.300 able to just get around that Noir it's
00:11:31.320 gonna be great so he's really gonna have
00:11:33.180 to get into exceed that really puts on
00:11:34.680 pressure for the board so we are going
00:11:38.519 to see
00:11:40.860 the
00:11:42.600 pearly player do a big thing here
00:11:44.459 because he can use Pearl Lily to attach
00:11:46.260 and then exceed so we are going to see
00:11:49.800 right now a decision between Beauty and
00:11:53.940 um happiness
00:11:56.040 either an otk engine or the effect
00:11:58.980 negate or in the attach
00:12:01.140 but we really need something for board
00:12:03.240 presence so we are going to see the
00:12:06.240 attach of a happy memory with beauty
00:12:11.100 and
00:12:13.200 we have a sleeping memory in hand which
00:12:15.120 is just going to be used to attach and
00:12:16.800 hopefully fatten up the Noir but however
00:12:19.620 delicious yet which is unfortunate and
00:12:22.500 that is really going to hurt we need to
00:12:25.079 get the Noir on the field Noir would
00:12:27.060 really just be able to get you through
00:12:28.680 this
00:12:29.640 I'd say the Sleepy memory
00:12:32.700 we're going to attach it to the Noir
00:12:37.019 and then just see
00:12:39.480 um sleepy memory get attached from
00:12:40.920 graveyard at the end phase through the
00:12:45.540 um field spell and then the draw two
00:12:47.040 because
00:12:48.139 Noir has the materials that allow you to
00:12:52.079 draw which is the insane part about the
00:12:54.839 stock you're able to just draw four
00:12:57.360 basically every turn once you get going
00:12:59.399 so
00:13:01.079 we're going to see the mirror sword and
00:13:02.880 I can search off the coddle which is
00:13:04.980 really just going to if I'm not
00:13:06.899 interrupted destroy the Pearly player's
00:13:09.120 day and looks like it's going to go
00:13:11.040 unterrupted because we don't have no arm
00:13:13.200 we don't have a
00:13:16.019 um hand trap
00:13:19.019 we're really going for ash or bust here
00:13:21.060 we see the thrust though which is just
00:13:23.399 insane because
00:13:26.940 we apparently used a monster effect
00:13:28.740 before that I'm assuming that was Noir
00:13:30.959 and we were going to see the brand
00:13:32.399 fusion and get search off the thrust
00:13:34.019 which is why branded is really the best
00:13:36.899 act to run thrust besides Unchained
00:13:38.880 you're able to search your best card and
00:13:40.620 activate it or board Breakers
00:13:43.680 we are going to see the gazelle and
00:13:45.839 albaz come down for most likely a
00:13:47.880 written Brom and we have five materials
00:13:49.680 obviously so this
00:13:51.300 cat is quite fat but
00:13:54.839 it's definitely audible so we are going
00:13:58.019 to see the red Brum
00:14:02.339 but since it's not the Noir
00:14:04.019 unfortunately the big Noir it's not
00:14:07.019 gonna be unaffected and
00:14:10.019 we are going to then just see
00:14:14.000 a search uh normal some in the mirror or
00:14:17.100 rare sword night effect
00:14:19.380 uh get the perfect match special summon
