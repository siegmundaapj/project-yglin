00:00:05.600 Wesker 99 with 1,171 rating so it's

00:00:16.560 decide to go first 42 versus 40 opening
00:00:19.279 hands we have pot of prosperity imperm
00:00:21.560 ogre Fen reer and lightning storm they
00:00:23.920 have Mir sword Knight Master toe
00:00:26.439 Patchwork cross out and imperm so we
00:00:29.279 have Chim
00:00:30.960 versus most likely 10p right they didn't
00:00:34.200 decide to go second or anything yeah but
00:00:36.200 it still looks like 10p um so they're
00:00:38.520 going to go ahead activate Patchwork
00:00:40.480 Patchwork go ahead search out poly and
00:00:43.120 EDM chain okay now normal summon out
00:00:46.160 sword Knight effect tribute bring out
00:00:48.079 gazelle gazelle effect chain imperm and
00:00:50.960 then chain cross out calling imperm so
00:00:53.840 we still get to go ahead and search out
00:00:55.480 the Chimera Fusion then Chimera Fusion
00:00:58.960 to go ahead bring out King and then one
00:01:01.239 two three so search search riptor in the
00:01:03.920 end phase grab out the patchwork the
00:01:06.840 nightmare Apprentice I mean technically
00:01:08.439 we could have ogre the king there to
00:01:10.720 stop them from getting a rank
00:01:13.280 six uh but it feels kind of bad cuz then
00:01:16.119 we only start our turn with three cards
00:01:17.799 in hand uh but it's like I don't know I
00:01:21.079 feel like this H it's so tough here
00:01:22.720 anyways Cher Fusion effect to add back
00:01:25.759 and then discard Patchwork summon out
00:01:27.479 nightmare Apprentice nightmare
00:01:28.920 Apprentice effect I guess I guess you
00:01:30.119 could also just save the ogre for this
00:01:32.640 yeah I guess it makes sense to actually
00:01:34.360 just save ogre for this if you're just
00:01:35.560 trying to get rid of the level six body
00:01:38.119 um so they do go ahead and ogre that and
00:01:40.560 then search out
00:01:42.040 cornfield now cornfield discard go
00:01:44.640 search out big wied um but they can
00:01:46.840 actually still get to it if they want

00:05:19.759 okay and this yeah this one go to get
00:05:21.680 its effect okay so Ash
00:05:24.360 actually is pretty decent but they're
00:05:26.680 going to lightning storm I was going to
00:05:28.160 say never mind Ash doesn't do anything I
00:05:29.880 was thinking that we could ask Guardian
00:05:31.240 Chimera but we're just going to liting
00:05:32.360 storm the back row to force it out now
00:05:34.199 and then obviously they can't make
00:05:36.000 Guardian Chimera and do anything with it
00:05:38.319 so they're just going to bring out a
00:05:40.680 guua sure that's fine doesn't do
00:05:43.840 anything uh especially under
00:05:46.520 shifter then activate summoning go ahead

00:06:23.000 attack for game yep so yeah attack for
00:06:26.639 12,000 there uh it sucks that they
00:06:28.960 didn't have
00:06:30.160 like you know a non-engine card to be
00:06:33.039 able to
00:06:34.280 interact uh I mean they had they had
00:06:38.120 cross out but yeah shifter's tough
00:06:41.800 shifter is very tough shifter with
00:06:44.039 engine uh you know and they have like
00:06:45.960 double talents that just like didn't do
00:06:48.080 anything and the patchwork didn't really
00:06:50.479 do anything really all it was was just
00:06:53.000 sword Knight and a cross out and cross
00:06:55.919 out all it did was stop imperm on sword
00:06:58.120 Knight so they didn't really have
00:06:59.879 anything going for them there I mean
00:07:01.599 shifter is a really broken card uh you
00:07:03.759 know there's not too much to say about
00:07:05.120 that um but okay yeah that's going to be
00:07:07.560 it for the match the match was pretty
00:07:09.199 quick there yeah it was only about 15
00:07:11.360 minutes long uh also I guess it was kind
00:07:14.680 of cool that like game two we saw the
00:07:17.199 master toe uh get changed to attack
00:07:20.479 position and then just you know slap
00:07:22.199 over it infinite
00:07:23.960 times sounds like cool um but okay yeah
00:07:27.720 that is going to be it for the the video
00:07:30.599 and with that being said the DB grinder
00:07:32.680 signing off peace have a nice day stay
