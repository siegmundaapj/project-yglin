00:00:40.440 channel and let's dive into our round
00:00:42.180 four match between Alex the Rika Sun
00:00:44.520 Avalon player versus myself playing
00:00:46.620 Vanquish soul
00:00:55.190 [Music]
00:00:57.120 all right kicking off round four we have
00:00:59.879 Alex on the left he is playing the
00:01:01.500 Eureka Sun Avalon and I am on the right
00:01:03.780 playing Vanquish Soul this was part of
00:01:05.939 our tournament and this should be a
00:01:07.619 pretty good match this is obviously
00:01:08.700 round four I think that we are both X1
00:01:12.479 going into this so obviously winner goes
00:01:15.600 into the top four Cuts so let's see
00:01:18.240 who's gonna go first this is gonna be
00:01:19.380 big on who goes first because obviously
00:01:20.939 Rika unchecked can be insane so I think
00:01:24.780 that Alex did win the die roll here
00:01:28.920 um let's see what happens
00:01:31.320 if he does have the nib in him which is
00:01:33.479 good we are going to see an unexpected
00:01:34.799 die you can see that I have Ash uh never
00:01:37.200 correct to Ash the unexpected dye you
00:01:38.939 always want to Ash the sewing so that's
00:01:40.860 something just to note
00:01:42.360 um if they have unexpected dies not once
00:01:44.400 per turn and if they just have a normal
00:01:45.900 seven Loki you just got burnt and wasted
00:01:47.820 in Ash
00:01:48.960 so we are going to see a glamor come
00:01:50.880 down glamor is really good but this is
00:01:53.640 obviously a tell sign to maybe Ash
00:01:55.619 because he could but
00:01:57.479 probably not because you know that he
00:02:00.180 uh still hasn't even normal summoned so
00:02:03.000 he's going to go ahead and activate the
00:02:04.320 recap pedal effect pedal is then going
00:02:06.600 to go ahead and grab himself the mudon
00:02:08.098 uh mudon's usually something that you
00:02:09.959 always want to imperme sometimes I like
00:02:12.180 improving dryas too dry ice just does a
00:02:14.459 lot here we are gonna see him link off
00:02:17.220 the Loki for a dryas dries is going to
00:02:19.860 go ahead and grab sewing they're just
00:02:21.720 gonna go ahead and activate the sewing
00:02:22.800 we are going to Ash that that prevents
00:02:24.480 dry ice from doing everything that it
00:02:26.220 does so if you have improv sometimes
00:02:28.620 like drives but Ashley and perm usually
00:02:30.540 I'm going to imperme the mudon and then
00:02:32.280 Ash the sewing it's just really good you
00:02:34.080 can see that Alex does have hand traps
00:02:36.360 though he has Ash in he has nib and we
00:02:38.879 know that he has moved on in hand so I
00:02:41.280 don't know what his other card is here
00:02:44.640 Alex has been playing Rika for a while
00:02:46.500 so let's see what it does here
00:02:49.019 he is gonna go ahead and summon out the
00:02:52.019 princess now he's gonna go ahead and
00:02:53.580 activate the mudon mudon attributing the
00:02:56.040 princess that's gonna go ahead and grab
00:02:57.239 him the Kong Kong Kong being a broken
00:02:59.280 field spell that just says that you
00:03:01.019 contribute your opponent's monster to
00:03:02.940 activate any of your cards which is just
00:03:04.560 insane because you can't respond because
00:03:06.239 it's tributed for cost and so he just
00:03:08.519 attributes it it's actually it's
00:03:11.280 actually a broken card
00:03:13.440 um
00:03:16.080 so let's see what he does here I think
00:03:17.700 that he set sheet I would assume that he
00:03:19.500 set sheet I wasn't paying attention but
00:03:21.060 I think he probably said sheet
00:03:25.019 and we are gonna go ahead and
00:03:28.260 see The Petal and see the dry eyes be
00:03:31.620 linked up for probably the dance peon or
00:03:33.180 Jasmine he's gonna go dance fion here
00:03:35.099 the espion effect's gonna activate he's
00:03:36.840 gonna go ahead and Mill to miss it's a
00:03:38.340 miss and it's a Miss
00:03:40.159 Unfortunate that it's a triple Miss
00:03:42.420 there no plants so obviously if it was a
00:03:44.760 plane he could have special back then he
00:03:46.920 could have gone for maybe a strunout
00:03:49.080 play potentially if he was able to make
00:03:52.200 them level four but she does have
00:03:54.299 princess in the graveyard to make them
00:03:55.739 level four so he could have went with
00:03:57.000 strena there but unfortunately not able
00:03:59.519 to even hit one plant one plant would
00:04:01.080 have made a big difference there
00:04:01.980 actually because he could have made both
00:04:03.720 in level four made strena then he'd have
00:04:05.879 another way to Tribute to create another
00:04:07.680 interruption
00:04:09.360 but at the time obviously I was making
00:04:11.280 best deal so we're gonna see a stick
00:04:13.319 your soul revealing the Magnemite he's
00:04:15.239 gonna go ahead and Ash that let's see if
00:04:17.339 that was a bait
00:04:19.019 we do have a bell here in hand which
00:04:21.120 obviously Bell not good again this
00:04:22.380 matchup especially because he didn't go
00:04:23.820 for the twin uh but we are going to go
00:04:26.160 ahead and Bell the pedals coming back at
00:04:28.979 the end phase so it looks like I'm
00:04:30.120 passing over to him
00:04:31.620 and so he's thinking if he wants to go
00:04:33.240 ahead and negate with the Rica princess
00:04:39.419 let's see what he decides to do he's
00:04:41.580 gonna okay that so
00:04:43.320 we're gonna pass let's see what he does
00:04:45.120 here he's gonna go Kong Kong Kong's
00:04:46.620 gonna go ahead and set a glamor
00:04:48.660 and depending on what my hand is this
00:04:51.240 could get out of hand for me
00:04:53.520 because you know Rika they just they
00:04:55.320 have extenders for days they don't play
00:04:57.000 a lot of going second cards but the
00:04:59.220 engine it's like branded where the
00:05:00.900 engine's just so good it can play
00:05:02.639 through so much
00:05:04.380 and obviously now one Rika winning Nats
00:05:07.860 is gonna make this deck more popular so
00:05:09.419 you definitely need to be prepared for
00:05:10.680 this deck Rika is going to be really I
00:05:12.360 think in the North American Nas that are
00:05:13.919 coming up we're gonna see a lot of Rika
00:05:15.240 so if you're not prepared for Rika you
00:05:16.500 definitely have to be so he's going to
00:05:18.479 go ahead and bring out the pedal pedal
00:05:20.340 effects gonna go ahead and activate
00:05:21.240 probably gonna grab Snowdrop this time
00:05:25.440 I'll wave that graveyard let's see what
00:05:27.120 he does
00:05:28.500 he is gonna grab Snowdrop
00:05:33.060 and he is gonna go dance piano and make
00:05:35.280 those both level four
00:05:36.960 that's gonna be able to Overlay for the
00:05:38.460 strena effect's gonna go ahead and
00:05:39.960 activate that's going to go ahead and
00:05:41.039 add back a Rika card back from the
00:05:42.539 graveyard to the hand
00:05:44.220 let's see what he decides to do
00:05:47.220 he's gonna grab the pedal back
00:05:51.840 no he's not gonna grab the pedal he's
00:05:53.699 gonna grab the pedal okay decides to
00:05:55.919 grab the pedal
00:05:57.300 so we have drool we have nib we have
00:06:00.060 pedal and we have snow drops so
00:06:01.620 snowdrop's gonna go ahead and tribute
00:06:03.180 off the strena that's going to special
00:06:04.800 out the pedal and that's going to sped
00:06:06.300 out special out the Snowdrop starting
00:06:09.060 effect then activate because it was
00:06:10.620 tributed that's going to bring out the
00:06:11.759 Big Moose the sacred tree and then now
00:06:13.979 Snowdrop can make both of those level
00:06:15.419 eight and he can actually just go for a
00:06:17.039 teardrop here and yeah he's got teardrop
00:06:20.400 plus a monster negate at this time plus
00:06:23.160 his Rica sheet set so he's in a good
00:06:24.720 position withdrawing his hand and nib so
00:06:27.780 let's see what he does here he's gonna
00:06:28.979 go ahead and battle attack with Snowdrop
00:06:31.020 attack with the sacred tree attack with
00:06:32.460 dance peon that's probably gonna put us
00:06:34.560 down to
00:06:36.600 pretty low life I mean quick math there
00:06:39.360 I saw a 28 I saw a 12 and I saw whatever
00:06:42.060 the Moose is at so I'm assuming we're at
00:06:44.759 very very low life points here we're
00:06:46.319 gonna go ahead and draw
00:06:47.699 let's see what we have we're gonna go
00:06:49.500 stake your soul reveal Curry Cara here
00:06:51.960 so
00:06:53.220 obviously revealing that we have Curry
00:06:55.440 car is not ideal but it does make our
00:06:58.039 deck live here so let's see what we do
00:07:04.199 and if he if he activates the Moose to
00:07:06.240 negate how do you just contribute here
00:07:07.919 so we're gonna bring out raisin
00:07:09.780 raise an effect will then activate as
00:07:11.759 priority and you're going to be able to
00:07:13.080 get a search if he does tribute it with
00:07:15.780 Rika sheet it's still going to get the
00:07:17.759 effect to search so
00:07:20.759 let's see maybe who goes princess here
00:07:22.380 princess being the smart call
00:07:26.580 and he's gonna attribute off our raisin
00:07:28.319 to negate it and that's going to be it
00:07:30.660 we are going to move on to game number
00:07:32.280 two that was actually really smart play
00:07:33.360 because he knows that I had to reveal
00:07:34.979 kurikara so being able to go in there
00:07:36.900 Renegade it with Princess and tribute my
00:07:39.000 raisin obviously huge there but we are
00:07:42.360 going to see Bakersfield go first so
00:07:43.740 let's go ahead and side out and move on
00:07:45.599 to game number two
00:07:48.660 all right moving on to game number two
00:07:51.539 and we're gonna see myself on the right
00:07:53.819 going first obviously gentle reminders
00:07:55.740 please consider subscribing help us get
00:07:57.599 two four thousand if you enjoy this kind
00:07:59.759 of content please let us know down below
00:08:01.139 I enjoy doing this kind of videos so all
00:08:04.080 right we're gonna go ahead and see a
00:08:05.340 Prosperity starting it off we're gonna
00:08:06.900 go ahead and banish six
00:08:09.780 it's kind of funny seeing how much my
00:08:11.880 deck has evolved from now until what I'm
00:08:14.880 playing at you know what I'm considering
00:08:16.319 playing at now it's just it's just so
00:08:17.940 funny so we're gonna see double small
00:08:19.080 world dust devil double fantasmate and
00:08:21.960 then the Caesar so
00:08:24.259 interesting interesting picks here
00:08:26.879 double phantasmate obviously not broken
00:08:28.740 up when we cite it in
00:08:31.139 so we are going to go ahead and grab
00:08:32.399 small world here
00:08:34.440 let's see if we get met with a drool
00:08:36.179 obviously this uh competition was done a
00:08:39.179 couple weeks ago at this point now so
00:08:41.099 just still reading the vakres soul cards
00:08:43.320 they're gonna go small world reveal the
00:08:44.940 bestio here that's gonna get met with an
00:08:46.500 ash
00:08:47.519 interestingly enough deciding not to Ash
00:08:50.339 the pot of prosperity
00:08:53.640 uh but we are going to see it unexpected
00:08:55.620 die come down we're gonna link off the
00:08:57.600 on the Loki here that's gonna go ahead
00:08:59.580 and bring out the dryas dries effect is
00:09:02.040 then going to go ahead and activate it's
00:09:03.060 going to grow AB sewing we're going to
00:09:04.380 activate sewing that's going to get met
00:09:05.580 with an ash Blossom and let's see if
00:09:07.500 that does it for for Alex's hand let's
00:09:09.180 see if he's got enough engine to push
00:09:10.560 through if he's gonna have to pass
00:09:12.600 he is gonna have to pass so we're gonna
00:09:14.640 get another chance here
00:09:16.440 we're gonna think on what to do we do
00:09:18.300 have a drill and another Ash in our hand
00:09:20.040 so
00:09:22.740 it looks like we're just passing back
00:09:24.000 and forth until somebody gets some
00:09:25.140 engine
00:09:27.480 unfortunate okay I've set a card now
00:09:30.600 let's see what we do we're gonna send
00:09:32.880 the Drone lockbird to Tribute someone
00:09:34.380 for the bistio Magnemite
00:09:36.899 I don't even know why I still have
00:09:38.100 biscuits in this match I must have
00:09:39.360 nothing else to side out
00:09:41.100 um but obviously we're going to
00:09:42.540 attribute some in our drill that we set
00:09:43.920 and that's going to summon a bistio
00:09:45.360 we're going to be able to attack
00:09:46.860 directly for 25 here
00:09:49.260 or are we not going to because we don't
00:09:51.120 want to trigger the dry ass that is the
00:09:52.620 question because actually attacking here
00:09:54.540 actually might not be the correct play
00:09:56.160 because then and we don't attack because
00:09:58.680 then we would set up our dryas so it
00:10:00.300 dries effect will activate the special
00:10:01.980 someone from the extra deck if it takes
00:10:03.720 effect damage so and that's exactly what
00:10:06.600 he's doing here he attacked into my
00:10:08.880 bistio Magnum protected it with sewing
00:10:11.279 he took the damage gained the life back
00:10:13.740 in any special out healer because he
00:10:15.959 took damage so that was a really smart
00:10:17.640 play by him and because he had sewing in
00:10:19.260 the graveyard he was able to protect it
00:10:20.640 but it does force the sewing which is
00:10:22.560 really good for me so
00:10:25.019 he is going to go ahead and Link off the
00:10:26.459 driest and the Healer that's going to go
00:10:28.320 into
00:10:30.000 a dance peon now here seeing that he has
00:10:33.060 no engine in his hand that this has to
00:10:35.339 hit right but that is going to get met
00:10:37.080 with an ash Blossom because it does
00:10:38.399 special summon
00:10:39.779 so we are going to ask the dance peon
00:10:41.220 and I think that's gonna make him pass
00:10:42.660 here so that was a good Ash Blossom
00:10:43.980 because it does excavate and special
00:10:45.959 summon so it can be ashed
00:10:49.200 and obviously having double Ash you have
00:10:52.019 to play Oh lights going in and out here
00:10:54.660 it's unfortunate
00:10:56.399 but obviously you know double ass you
00:10:57.959 have to play your game the way that you
00:10:59.880 think is the best against your opponent
00:11:01.260 but he does have a Thrust in hand thrust
00:11:02.640 is going to go ahead and grab glamor
00:11:03.660 that's really good it does turn his
00:11:05.220 engine on live but then we're going to
00:11:06.360 go ahead and meet that with a troll so
00:11:08.339 drill unfortunate because now the glamor
00:11:10.740 is dead in hand so Ash into a drool
00:11:14.160 stops his hand and hopefully we just
00:11:16.320 need one more turn to get this game
00:11:17.519 started here so he's gonna go talents
00:11:19.140 like a hand he hits the other Ash
00:11:20.700 blossom in the hand we obviously have
00:11:21.839 another bistio Magnemite in hand
00:11:25.380 so he is going to go ahead and Shuffle
00:11:26.700 back the ash
00:11:28.920 and all we need here is a top deck
00:11:31.079 raisin we should be good to go let's see
00:11:32.820 what happens
00:11:34.440 I see it I do see it top deck raisin
00:11:37.440 so raisin is effect is then going to go
00:11:39.779 ahead and activate we know we have a
00:11:40.860 dark in hand so do we grab a fire to pop
00:11:42.959 the dance peon that is a good question
00:11:45.000 here I don't think that we do no we do
00:11:47.700 we definitely set up our engine now so
00:11:49.019 we're gonna grab mad love even though
00:11:50.459 that's too dark in hand it's okay we're
00:11:52.620 gonna go ahead and Link off the raisin
00:11:53.940 that's for go for a rock of the
00:11:55.200 vanquisher rock of the vanquisher
00:11:56.459 effects gonna go ahead and activate it's
00:11:57.660 gonna special out to mad love that's
00:11:59.579 gonna go ahead and grab what I believe
00:12:00.899 is going to be continue here because now
00:12:02.399 we can set up a
00:12:04.380 um Zeus line
00:12:09.779 I think we're thinking on what we want
00:12:11.100 to search
00:12:16.680 I think if the players continue here
00:12:18.240 let's see what I decide to go with
00:12:19.500 though
00:12:24.060 it's a big thing and uh
00:12:26.579 we're digging through the deck now we do
00:12:28.500 grab continue okay I do think that's the
00:12:30.360 correct play
00:12:33.120 even if you're just setting continue to
00:12:35.579 bring back on your opponent's turn it's
00:12:37.260 still good because your engine is now
00:12:38.519 live and rolling
00:12:47.220 all right so we are going to
00:12:51.000 link off the bistio magnavite oh I think
00:12:53.940 maybe we're thinking about a chaos Angel
00:12:55.200 line
00:12:56.279 chaos Angel's not bad because I know
00:12:58.680 that we were playing it here or I
00:13:00.480 banished it I was going for chaos Angel
00:13:02.040 but then I realized that I banished it
00:13:03.300 off of the prosperity so I actually did
00:13:05.399 not I had chaos Angel but it was
00:13:07.620 unfortunately banished
00:13:13.320 so obviously this is a big moment here
00:13:14.880 so we're just thinking of what we want
00:13:16.920 to do I think uh we're attempting to go
00:13:19.139 to battle phase
00:13:26.100 I do think that
00:13:27.660 all we have to do is we we can set up
00:13:30.120 Zeus because obviously our opponent is
00:13:31.560 top decking here we know he has glamor
00:13:33.899 but he has to be able to oh we are just
00:13:36.959 gonna attack okay
00:13:39.899 so he could go glamor glamor could grab
00:13:41.820 pedal but then we could just wipe the
00:13:43.019 pedal when it summoned he does have an
00:13:44.820 evenly matched here so
00:13:47.940 um I do think that we should have
00:13:49.800 went continue
00:13:53.120 brought out borbo set up Zeus line he
00:13:57.420 does have nib though so I would have
00:13:58.500 played into nib actually
00:14:00.420 one two
00:14:02.519 three four five yeah so that would have
00:14:04.380 played into nib
00:14:05.579 let's see if I still do play into nibs
00:14:07.320 so we're gonna go Magno effect Magna is
00:14:09.060 going to search it in phase and that is
00:14:12.480 gonna be four summons so we have played
00:14:14.160 around nib that's really good we set
00:14:16.440 continue that's gonna allow follow up on
00:14:18.120 our opponent's turn possibly get a pop
00:14:20.519 depending on if we can search Drews from
00:14:22.680 here
00:14:23.700 or yes we did play into nib okay
00:14:27.839 in Phase we're gonna search we grab
00:14:29.399 Fantasmic that's obviously an insane
00:14:32.100 card to grab off of the magnet I do like
00:14:34.500 that play grabbing phantasmic off of
00:14:36.480 especially in a moment like this where
00:14:37.560 you have low cards in hand you can grab
00:14:39.420 fantasma off of your um opponent's
00:14:42.959 Alpha the Magna and then being able to
00:14:46.019 just draw more cards on your opponent's
00:14:47.579 turn so I'm gonna see a glamor come down
00:14:49.560 glamor's gonna go ahead and grab pedal
00:14:52.199 you know normal something pedal pedal
00:14:53.940 effects can then probably activate
00:15:05.339 so I can grab a Rika card
00:15:08.820 we're gonna go ahead and bring out
00:15:09.899 raisin oh so we're gonna bring out
00:15:11.459 raisin now
00:15:13.680 we're gonna go ahead and grab pluton so
00:15:15.660 before he can activate the effective
00:15:17.220 pedal so on summon we're going to go
00:15:19.079 ahead and activate continue continue is
00:15:20.459 going to bring out raisin we're going to
00:15:21.839 search the pluton I'm going to activate
00:15:23.279 raise and effect and we're going to go
00:15:24.540 ahead and pop The Petal so obviously
00:15:26.699 that's a really good play there
00:15:29.160 just deals with that normal summon and
00:15:31.800 we know that he had glamor search the
00:15:33.720 pedal and we know he's on no other
00:15:34.740 engine so that should be able to
00:15:36.540 actually just stop him and hold him out
00:15:40.320 so he's got cross out
00:15:42.660 um I can't see what else he has in hand
00:15:46.860 he's gonna nib battle over our raisin
00:15:48.839 which is fine I know our token is chunky
00:15:52.199 I think
00:15:53.699 I guess it was only a magnet that was
00:15:55.199 attributed so we're gonna actually
00:15:56.399 special summon out the pluton so pluton
00:15:58.980 being able to special someone out at in
00:16:01.139 Phase here that's going to go ahead oh I
00:16:03.180 have to control another Vanquish Soul
00:16:04.320 monster so you actually can't uh we're
00:16:06.120 gonna go stank your soul it's a good
00:16:07.620 thing we didn't because we're gonna
00:16:08.579 reveal the pluton so because we then get
00:16:11.220 to some because we didn't summon it now
00:16:12.600 we can reveal it off of stink your soul
00:16:14.100 that's gonna go ahead and bring out
00:16:15.180 raisin raisin effect is then going to go
00:16:16.860 ahead and activate let's see what we
00:16:18.480 grab here
00:16:21.600 we're gonna grab a heavy Burger
00:16:25.260 yep we're gonna grab heavy Burger and
00:16:27.480 now we can go ahead and activate raise
00:16:28.680 and effect and we can go ahead and pop
00:16:30.360 the nib by revealing a dark and a fire
00:16:33.560 and this is probably going to be 4 000
00:16:37.560 on field or give or take so if we have a
00:16:40.740 way to
00:16:43.019 go into game here
00:16:45.240 we could actually
00:16:46.920 hmm
00:16:48.600 we're gonna summon Burger bounce raisin
00:16:50.519 back to hand activate Burger effect
00:16:51.779 reveal the fantasmay that's gonna allow
00:16:53.820 us to draw a card
00:16:58.620 see what we draw into
00:17:00.420 that's why I like this engine so much it
00:17:02.339 looks like an ash Blossom that's huge
00:17:04.319 huge because that's going to keep our
00:17:06.000 opponent obviously so he's got a
00:17:07.439 Snowdrop in hand so he know we know he
00:17:09.720 has snow dropping cross out I don't know
00:17:11.220 what his other car is but obviously he
00:17:12.359 would just be able to control the game
00:17:13.500 now we are going to go ahead and
00:17:16.260 normal summon raisin oh he just picks up
00:17:19.559 his cards okay so he picks up his cards
00:17:21.599 we are gonna move on to game number
00:17:23.579 three one-on-one rika's obviously gonna
00:17:26.880 start so we're gonna have to open up
00:17:28.199 hand traps to be able to stop our
00:17:29.460 opponent here so let's see what happens
00:17:31.080 moving on to game number three
00:17:36.240 all right moving on to game number three
00:17:39.059 let's see if we are able to open up any
00:17:41.820 of our going second cards because that's
00:17:43.380 gonna be what's gonna be huge going up
00:17:44.580 against Rika only because Rika if they
00:17:47.580 pop off I mean it's just basically it's
00:17:50.039 a Sprint to the Finish Line it's just
00:17:51.660 very hard to deal with a Rika inboard
00:17:53.520 because even cards like Dark Ruler
00:17:56.580 don't do much against it because they
00:17:58.260 have Ricochet they have konkon and they
00:18:00.240 have princess and graveyard which plays
00:18:02.100 around obviously being able to dark
00:18:03.720 roller here so I obviously started the
00:18:06.240 video just a tad bit early because I
00:18:08.580 thought we were ready to get started but
00:18:10.020 we gotta change one card there so
00:18:13.260 um yeah this is like very important to
00:18:15.360 be able to open up cards like drool or
00:18:17.340 shifter or things like that that
00:18:19.740 actually put in work against Rika
00:18:21.960 because if you don't and they pop off
00:18:23.640 again it's a very very very hard match
00:18:25.980 up for you so let's see what we end up
00:18:29.280 doing here
00:18:30.539 all right let's get started I'm assuming
00:18:32.700 that Alex is gonna go first here so
00:18:34.440 let's see if he's able to start with
00:18:36.539 some engine or a few bricks that is
00:18:38.220 another thing that the deck can break
00:18:39.919 and uh sometimes one Ash will do it so
00:18:42.600 let's see
00:18:43.919 draw out our hands
00:18:47.400 and we see oh I think I see all hand
00:18:52.380 traps
00:18:54.000 so we're gonna oh no he said an
00:18:55.500 unexpected die never mind ignore that so
00:18:58.260 he does have hand traps but the
00:19:00.120 unexpected dive bringing out Loki
00:19:01.740 obviously that's full combo let's see if
00:19:03.720 we're able to stop him with any going
00:19:05.400 second cards here so and he does have
00:19:07.559 princess in hand so do keep that in mind
00:19:10.020 we're gonna drool him on this search of
00:19:12.179 sewing that's really good there but he
00:19:14.039 does have crossout designators so we're
00:19:15.600 going to see crossout designator come
00:19:17.039 down that's going to be able to negate
00:19:18.660 the drool by banishing a copy of it so
00:19:20.880 he's able to stop the draw huge there
00:19:22.740 now he's gonna go ahead and activate
00:19:23.940 sewing sewing effect is then going to go
00:19:25.740 ahead and bring out what appears to be a
00:19:27.419 twin out of band so we're gonna do chain
00:19:29.220 link one twin chain link two dry as dry
00:19:31.320 ass will gain back the Thousand that he
00:19:32.880 just took off of The Sewing and special
00:19:34.620 summon out a sunbine Healer from the
00:19:36.480 graveyard or from the extra deck and
00:19:38.280 then twin will bring out the Loki healer
00:19:40.620 will Target dryas gain 300 life points
00:19:42.299 and now he's gonna link both the dry ice
00:19:43.919 and the Healer off for a Jasmine then
00:19:46.140 he's gonna link the twin off for a
00:19:49.200 um another dry s and when he does that
00:19:51.179 we're gonna go ahead and drop the rock
00:19:53.280 on him so the nib drill combo there
00:19:55.919 crossout may have stopped the drool but
00:19:58.140 it did not stop the nib from coming down
00:20:00.240 so now we're gonna be able to go stake
00:20:02.220 your soul reveal the curry Cora and then
00:20:04.260 he's gonna meet that with an ash Blossom
00:20:06.000 we're gonna go ahead and battle over the
00:20:07.799 token with our nib
00:20:09.780 and then
00:20:13.320 uh I guess we're doing math here on what
00:20:15.539 the token was It was obviously pretty
00:20:17.220 low it sees that appears that somebody
00:20:19.320 has hit my camera but anyway so the
00:20:21.600 nibit does come down let's see if Alex
00:20:23.760 has any follow-up we know he has
00:20:25.140 princess in his hand and we I think that
00:20:27.000 he has
00:20:28.620 I don't know if we know the other card
00:20:30.179 or not
00:20:31.500 but he is unfortunately gonna have to
00:20:33.240 pass there so we do have another stake
00:20:36.900 your soul reveal Curry car that's going
00:20:38.400 to go ahead and bring out the raisin I
00:20:40.140 think he's got an impromptu he's gonna
00:20:41.220 go ahead and impermanent do we have the
00:20:42.840 out and can we bounce it we do have
00:20:44.520 Burger in hands we're gonna go ahead and
00:20:45.660 burger Target raisin it's gonna go ahead
00:20:47.340 and bounce the raisin back to hand
00:20:48.600 that's gonna special summon out the
00:20:50.580 burger that's gonna let raisin resolve
00:20:52.679 and we're gonna allow us to search so do
00:20:54.539 we grab mad love here do we grab a
00:20:56.160 Caesar
00:20:57.179 I think we're thinking about getting a
00:20:58.679 mad love we know that he's on top deck
00:21:00.179 here so we could grab ourselves a mad
00:21:02.340 love maybe get a night unless we side
00:21:04.380 out the um dust devil but
00:21:07.919 let's see I think we're thinking on what
00:21:09.240 we want to grab
00:21:11.160 we are going to grab a Caesar okay
00:21:13.200 interesting we're gonna grab Caesar
00:21:15.600 we know we have raisin in hand
00:21:19.380 but we are going to go ahead and normal
00:21:21.419 summon out the raising because we've
00:21:23.580 summoned it off of stake your soul and
00:21:25.559 then we can go ahead and bounce that
00:21:26.820 back grab Caesar Caesar plus the nib
00:21:30.120 plus the burger and that is 8 500 attack
00:21:33.240 so we're gonna go ahead and attack for
00:21:34.679 game there and that is how game number
00:21:36.480 three ends so the nib drill combo puts
00:21:39.900 in the Reika player and looks like I am
00:21:41.460 moving on to top four and in my top four
00:21:43.980 match I actually get my rematch against
00:21:45.960 Shane him and I play the mirror match
00:21:47.760 again so uh that should be an
00:21:49.980 interesting one make sure to subscribe
00:21:51.179 stay tuned for that and we're gonna dive
00:21:52.919 into top four hopefully posting tomorrow
00:21:54.720 since Shane and I are heading to Nats
00:21:56.520 where we should be able to post both top
00:21:57.840 four matches and the finals uh so you
00:22:00.120 get to go ahead and check those out but
00:22:01.200 this one is I'm gonna take it move on to
