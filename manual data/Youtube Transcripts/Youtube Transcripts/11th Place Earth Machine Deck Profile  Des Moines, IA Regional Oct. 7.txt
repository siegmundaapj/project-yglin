00:00:02.440 hey what's up everybody peeps here I
00:00:04.839 wanted
00:00:05.839 to upload a Deck Profile of the earth
00:00:08.960 machine list that I took to the De Moine
00:00:11.240 Iowa Regional this past weekend October
00:00:13.879 7th um I was super impressed with this
00:00:16.720 list I was impressed with how I played
00:00:18.680 except for the last round which whatever
00:00:20.320 you know I was close to a top eight I
00:00:21.640 got 11th like I said I went
00:00:23.800 X2 and it was it was really close I I
00:00:28.000 could there was definitely a world where
00:00:29.560 I played a little bit better and got a
00:00:31.039 top eight um so I'm I'm really impressed
00:00:33.160 with how the deck did I think it was
00:00:34.879 really good I think the choices I made
00:00:36.239 were great there are definitely some
00:00:37.960 non-standard engines when it comes to
00:00:39.960 Earth machine stuff that I am super
00:00:41.960 excited to talk about and give some
00:00:43.239 detail on and explain why I played it
00:00:45.960 but without further Ado let's just go
00:00:47.520 ahead and Jump Right In let's start with
00:00:49.039 the main deck it's a 40 card main deck
00:00:52.520 and I'll start off with starters move on
00:00:55.199 to extenders and engine pieces and then
00:00:57.800 I will talk about non-engine so for
00:01:00.760 starters of course we got to talk about
00:01:02.920 the best normal summon in all of
00:01:04.000 Yu-Gi-Oh which is infinit TR Harvester
00:01:06.360 this card is crazy it does everything
00:01:08.920 it's a one card combo on its own to get
00:01:10.840 you to the draw two plus anger knuckle
00:01:13.400 it also is a uh the level modulation
00:01:17.680 effect allows you to otk going second
00:01:20.000 now that we have regulus which we've had
00:01:21.759 for a while but you can do the combo in
00:01:24.799 such a way where you go Harvester search
00:01:26.439 dozer effect summon Dozer and then
00:01:28.360 summon trencher you make storm to search
00:01:30.400 regulus then you use the trencher to
00:01:32.600 summon back this Harvester Harvester
00:01:34.759 targets regulus to make these both level
00:01:36.600 10 and then you make Gustav liba right
00:01:39.200 there
00:01:40.159 so by itself it is a one card combo to
00:01:44.640 otk and it uh is insulated through Garn
00:01:48.280 that combo is insulated through garnets
00:01:50.119 so if you draw Ancient gear box you can
00:01:52.200 still just with this one card like it
00:01:54.040 doesn't have to interact with ballista
00:01:55.320 or in gear box at all I mean unless you
00:01:57.479 need to use ballista to reduce an attack
00:01:59.079 of a monster but but that doesn't
00:02:00.479 require a box being in the deck still so
00:02:03.680 pretty cool um next up is three scrap
00:02:08.560 recycler so this is pretty weird it is
00:02:11.640 definitely non-standard but there's a
00:02:13.480 lot of cool stuff that this card can do
00:02:15.800 it sends any machine which for the most
00:02:18.920 part will be Harvester if you're using
00:02:20.519 it as a starter um it's not a one card
00:02:23.360 combo on its own it does require a
00:02:25.000 machine extender but there are so many
00:02:27.000 of those in the deck that it is still
00:02:29.239 valuable
00:02:30.400 and it's very
00:02:32.239 flexible you can do things like send
00:02:34.160 Citadel you can send regulus if you have
00:02:37.680 a regulus in hand so you can go regulus
00:02:39.560 Target regulus which is very strong um
00:02:42.840 yeah it just does a lot it's and yeah it
00:02:46.280 the the combo for it is you summon it
00:02:49.840 send Harvester and then you summon your
00:02:52.239 extender uh link the two off into
00:02:54.080 ballista ballista search box box search
00:02:56.519 trencher you summon the trencher link it
00:02:58.720 off to get it engraved then you trencher
00:03:00.560 effect for Harvester which gets you to
00:03:02.080 Dozer which is full combo so pretty cool
00:03:05.680 I enjoyed playing this over the mack
00:03:07.400 stuff you'll see throughout this profile
00:03:08.840 I don't play gearframe I don't play um
00:03:12.440 unless Spar I don't play all that I do
00:03:15.000 play ruin or not room Force I play
00:03:17.000 Citadel and overdrive but those are the
00:03:19.400 only Mo cards that I play the other ones
00:03:21.599 there's just so many bricks and clunky
00:03:23.720 cards that you are incentivized to play
00:03:26.200 if you play the MCH cards that it just
00:03:27.920 wasn't worth it to me I just wanted a
00:03:29.360 better normal summon that didn't require
00:03:31.319 another brick to play so I play recycler
00:03:33.239 and it was awesome I I I I loved it all
00:03:36.360 all all tournament and it's also a level
00:03:39.080 three machine so there are some Niche
00:03:40.760 situations where you can go Harvester
00:03:42.360 Target recycler make them both level
00:03:44.360 fives and then make Stormer that way it
00:03:46.040 it doesn't come up a lot but it can it
00:03:48.360 did come up for me twice at the
00:03:50.840 tournament so um yeah and then I played
00:03:54.400 three heavy forward it's tanky for
00:03:55.799 infinit TRX so pretty good your main
00:03:58.159 punish is you normal one of these and
00:04:00.319 then they interact with it with a hand
00:04:02.159 trap and then you activate heavy forward
00:04:03.760 to search for Dozer anyway so pretty
00:04:05.560 cool and then I played three foolish
00:04:08.360 goods and A Clockwork night so this card
00:04:12.360 this was probably my favorite engine of
00:04:13.879 the entire weekend I was
00:04:17.918 uh I was inspired to play it by some
00:04:21.199 theory about Unchained actually that
00:04:23.759 Joshua Schmidt talked about in his uh
00:04:26.479 deck building or on one of his streams
00:04:29.199 he was saying how in Unchained even
00:04:33.320 though you are playing a brick by
00:04:35.400 playing the DDD engine it's still worth
00:04:38.280 it because the thing that the contract
00:04:40.919 engine allows you to do makes your deck
00:04:42.759 like so flexible it's really powerful
00:04:44.360 raises the ceiling and I was like well
00:04:46.320 wait a minute that could be translated
00:04:48.919 to Earth machine as well because if you
00:04:50.639 play foolish Goods in A Clockwork night
00:04:52.199 that literally searches your entire deck
00:04:54.400 uh for those of you that don't know
00:04:55.479 Clockwork nights grave effect is you can
00:04:57.160 banish it from the grave discard one and
00:05:00.000 then search for any Earth machine so you
00:05:02.919 can use it as a starter to search
00:05:04.440 Harvester you can use it to search an
00:05:06.880 extender um you can use it to search
00:05:09.520 regulus which is massive um so like if
00:05:13.000 you draw into foolish Goods at the end
00:05:14.720 of a tunneler combo you can just foolish
00:05:17.039 goods for Clockwork night or you can
00:05:18.759 foolish goods for overdrive if you
00:05:20.160 wanted to get another random draw which
00:05:22.000 I do play overdrive as well uh so
00:05:25.440 overdrive was still good to include even
00:05:27.039 though I'm not playing redeployment or
00:05:28.400 any other Machina engine
00:05:30.479 cards I loved having this in the deck as
00:05:33.960 something that is just there for you
00:05:36.280 know accessibility to shuffle back my
00:05:38.080 Dozer targets it makes the longevity of
00:05:40.759 the deck crazy cuz you can Shuffle back
00:05:43.039 like tunneler and then later on in the
00:05:45.120 game you can use tunneler again to
00:05:46.720 shuffle back more cards so it's it was
00:05:48.800 really good to include as a one of I
00:05:50.680 wouldn't play any more of it but uh it
00:05:53.000 was great also Clockwork night I do just
00:05:54.720 want to talk about this card it's really
00:05:56.240 funny you might think it's like a really
00:05:58.400 bad brick if you draw it but it adds a
00:06:01.960 funny amount of board presence I guess
00:06:06.039 like there were matchups at the regional
00:06:08.800 that I just won games from because I
00:06:11.360 open Clockwork night I won a game
00:06:12.800 against unchain because I open Clockwork
00:06:14.400 night and I won two games versus plant
00:06:17.280 because I opened up Clockwork night so
00:06:19.440 really funny I think this card's
00:06:21.039 hilarious and just the fact that it
00:06:23.280 searches everything in your deck is is
00:06:25.120 great so it's it's a really nice
00:06:27.360 inclusion I wouldn't play any more than
00:06:28.639 one of it because you you don't want to
00:06:29.800 like depend on some weird like type
00:06:32.759 changing effect to win you the game but
00:06:34.680 there are matchups that are just made a
00:06:37.440 lot harder for your opponent if you do
00:06:39.280 draw it you know there's like plant
00:06:40.840 there's Unchained there's uh any cyber
00:06:43.599 stack like Salamon gr like anything that
00:06:45.840 their types matter it's good um it's
00:06:48.880 also okay one last thing about it if
00:06:51.199 your opponent plays Zombie World it
00:06:53.160 turns everything to zombies and then you
00:06:55.080 can start your turn by just activating
00:06:56.560 Clockwork night and overriding the
00:06:58.759 Zombie World effect so there are in
00:07:00.520 there are things that like matter by
00:07:02.160 having Clockwork KN in the deck so I
00:07:03.479 liked it a lot um extenders and engine
00:07:06.759 pieces first up
00:07:09.440 regulus three copies of it I another
00:07:12.879 reason why I didn't want to play the
00:07:14.160 Machina stuff is because the Macha
00:07:15.960 engine is really big like you have gear
00:07:18.919 frame unpar redeployment uh Citadel
00:07:22.440 Fortress overdrive ruin force it takes
00:07:25.280 up so much stuff in your deck and it it
00:07:28.319 you have to shave things things that are
00:07:29.960 really important to have like a third
00:07:31.800 regulus right I really really wanted
00:07:34.199 three regulus and it was great all
00:07:37.840 day um I always wanted to see this card
00:07:40.039 going first or second uh it adds so much
00:07:42.479 to your boards and it it makes your
00:07:44.240 going second game plans even better and
00:07:46.400 stronger so I loved having three of it
00:07:48.560 was great to play it um yeah I don't
00:07:52.080 know there's there's not much to say
00:07:53.000 there it's regulus it also sends itself
00:07:55.240 for cost which is very important for
00:07:58.479 another card I play in my main deck a
00:08:00.440 little bit of foreshadowing there but uh
00:08:02.199 anyway uh next up for extenders we have
00:08:05.400 of course the Dozer which is your like
00:08:09.199 your main extender it's the combo piece
00:08:11.440 that gets you to River Stormer I don't
00:08:14.120 play don't play more than one of it if
00:08:15.440 you're playing against anybody that
00:08:16.560 knows how to play against this deck
00:08:18.360 they're not going to hand trap your
00:08:19.560 normal summon they're going to save a
00:08:20.759 hand trap for the Dozer and then there's
00:08:22.840 no reason to play multiple Dozer at that
00:08:25.039 point uh because you know it doesn't add
00:08:27.840 anything through hand traps at all
00:08:30.000 so just play one of it uh next is
00:08:32.839 trencher this is your Mizuki for
00:08:34.200 infinite TRX I do only play one of this
00:08:36.399 uh I play one tunneler as well but I cut
00:08:38.799 the second trencher for one road roller
00:08:41.519 and I could not be more happy that I did
00:08:43.440 this card was amazing it adds so much to
00:08:46.240 the turn one um to to explain if you've
00:08:50.200 played Earth machine in the past you
00:08:51.560 have been in situations like this where
00:08:53.920 you have opened
00:08:55.640 Harvester and another heavy forward or
00:08:58.360 you've already opened Harvester Dozer or
00:09:00.079 you've open Harvester in a different
00:09:01.320 level five so it there are just a lot of
00:09:03.519 situations
00:09:04.720 where you you kind of clunk on so many
00:09:08.680 different engine pieces as it is where
00:09:10.360 you can't like proactively add something
00:09:12.320 else but Road Roller is something that's
00:09:15.720 really really nice to have one thing
00:09:18.959 that's super
00:09:20.160 important is for those of you that don't
00:09:22.560 know it's effect is if an earth machine
00:09:23.880 monster is tributed or banished face up
00:09:25.640 you can special summon this from the
00:09:26.839 graveyard if it was there when the
00:09:28.320 monster was tributed ban
00:09:29.760 or hand even if not but then banish it
00:09:31.880 when it leaves the field you can only
00:09:33.040 use that effect once per turn and then
00:09:34.560 an exceed Monster Who's original type of
00:09:36.320 machine that has this card as a material
00:09:38.680 can do like a semi bagusa effect it
00:09:41.079 changes everything to defense and then
00:09:42.560 they lose a th000 defense so that effect
00:09:45.200 doesn't come up a lot but the thing that
00:09:46.560 does come up is the thing to put itself
00:09:48.279 on the board when it's
00:09:49.760 tributed it also allows you to make
00:09:52.000 Mountain Smasher during your turn one
00:09:54.680 line if you have access to this and
00:09:56.720 having Mountain Smasher in your grave as
00:09:58.279 part of your setup is really good when
00:10:00.000 we'll get to the extra uh we'll talk
00:10:01.560 about it when we get to the extra deck
00:10:03.440 uh but the other thing is that it chain
00:10:04.800 blocks Dozer so if you um like if they
00:10:08.480 hold hand traps for the Dozer and you
00:10:10.959 normal Harvester and you already have a
00:10:12.440 heavy forward and you search for uh Road
00:10:16.000 Roller um or you search for you search
00:10:18.320 for Dozer and then use your heavy
00:10:19.360 forward to search for Road Roller you
00:10:21.519 Dozer tribute the Harvester you go Dozer
00:10:24.079 chain link one road roller chain link 2
00:10:25.880 and that protects the Dozer from Ash
00:10:27.920 Blossom and then not going to use an
00:10:29.640 effect negation on that because you're
00:10:31.279 already going to have two level FES so a
00:10:33.079 veiler would be like or an imperm would
00:10:35.160 there would be no purpose to it right so
00:10:37.320 um Dozer or Road Roller was great I will
00:10:39.880 definitely continue to play this card
00:10:41.880 phenomenal card I think it's it adds a
00:10:44.240 lot of value to the deck it was another
00:10:46.600 reason I wanted to play a smaller uh a
00:10:49.959 smaller supplemental engine instead of
00:10:52.120 something like mchina because I wanted
00:10:53.720 to fit this card in really really badly
00:10:55.680 so um I played a bullet train a der
00:10:59.519 Crane and a citadel I did still play
00:11:02.399 this card uh Citadel adds a lot of value
00:11:05.399 because you can send it off a scrap
00:11:06.680 recycler there's cool things you can do
00:11:09.000 like you when you activate urgent
00:11:11.079 schedule you can summon recycler and
00:11:13.399 Citadel and then you can summon
00:11:15.560 wivern and then you know the wyvern
00:11:18.120 plays are very strong another reason why
00:11:20.120 recycler is really good because it gives
00:11:21.560 you a push through D barrier um and then
00:11:23.839 Citadel is just a really good boss
00:11:25.040 monster so I definitely was happy to
00:11:26.800 include
00:11:27.959 that
00:11:29.680 and then my best friend the one of who
00:11:34.519 it is unbelievable how much this card
00:11:36.480 shows up in my hand I just I can't I
00:11:39.320 truly can't believe it it's a
00:11:40.600 statistical anomaly whenever you put
00:11:42.160 ancient gear box in a deck he just will
00:11:44.160 draw it I can't believe it but whatever
00:11:46.920 uh and then starting off with non-engine
00:11:49.279 this is still kind of a part of the
00:11:50.440 engine but it feels like a piece of
00:11:51.920 non-engine especially when you're going
00:11:53.160 second Cu uh urgent schedule is
00:11:55.920 basically game-winning if you activate
00:11:57.600 this card and it resolves it it puts so
00:11:59.720 much pressure on your opponent it
00:12:01.440 summons two machines it threatens liba
00:12:04.160 it it goes uh you know it summons scrap
00:12:07.079 wyvern which threatens their board uh it
00:12:09.639 does a lot this card was really strong I
00:12:12.279 was happy that it was in my main deck
00:12:13.760 but one of the kind of mistakes in deck
00:12:16.160 building is that I think I should have
00:12:17.920 played two in the main deck it is a use
00:12:20.320 not an activate so if you open multiples
00:12:22.279 of it um you'll never be able to use the
00:12:24.760 second one because if they negate it you
00:12:26.480 won't be able to act you know you won't
00:12:27.760 be able to use use it right um it you
00:12:32.040 can set it during your first turn and
00:12:34.440 try to block attacks or something like
00:12:36.279 that but it's 2023 like that never
00:12:39.000 really comes up so it it just it was
00:12:41.519 very strong it definitely helped me win
00:12:43.800 games throughout the day but I think I
00:12:45.880 would have been better shaving a copy of
00:12:47.800 it for something like a talents rather
00:12:50.040 than Ming three of it so I will be
00:12:51.440 moving one to the side and and that was
00:12:53.160 another mistake of this deck building is
00:12:54.760 that I did not put triple tactics Talent
00:12:56.639 anywhere in my list so uh that will be
00:12:58.680 something something I edit and one
00:13:00.040 Talent is going to go in over the third
00:13:01.519 urgent schedule so but this card is
00:13:03.839 phenomenal um and then of course the
00:13:08.000 best non-engine that Earth machine can
00:13:09.720 play is forbidden droplet which is it
00:13:12.480 makes me very happy that aise heart got
00:13:14.279 banned because when a rart was in the
00:13:15.920 format can't play this card but now that
00:13:18.399 it's gone we can and it is phenomenal
00:13:21.040 for this deck specifically you can go
00:13:23.399 cool stuff like activate urgent schedule
00:13:25.480 is chain link one chain link 2 forbidden
00:13:27.800 droplet uh send the Urgent
00:13:30.160 schedule um it helps you play through
00:13:32.360 droll CU you go like normal Harvester to
00:13:36.040 add Dozer and then you hold priority you
00:13:39.160 uh activate forbidden droplet send a
00:13:41.120 monster with holding the quick effect
00:13:42.959 priority and then they can't droll you
00:13:45.000 after you've added because they can't
00:13:46.519 respond with a monster and I did that I
00:13:49.040 think four times I don't know if it
00:13:51.600 mattered I don't know if they had droll
00:13:53.320 at any point but I just did it anyway
00:13:56.040 because you know one Harvester
00:13:58.000 resolution going second is game if you
00:14:00.639 can search regulus but you have to
00:14:02.079 search twice in order to do it so using
00:14:05.000 forbidden droplet to dodge droll is is
00:14:07.320 phenomenal
00:14:08.639 so um then the next thing I played was
00:14:12.320 three chalice my wife uh I love this
00:14:15.040 card chalice was surprisingly good all
00:14:18.160 day it just blanks problematic effects
00:14:22.240 that your opponent has right it um I
00:14:25.560 don't know it it's really good against
00:14:27.040 something like dweller um a lot better
00:14:29.240 than something like imperm is and yeah I
00:14:32.560 don't know I I like this card a lot I
00:14:34.120 was very impressed with it you can use
00:14:35.600 it defensively going you during your
00:14:37.160 first turn you can use it offensively uh
00:14:40.800 when you're going second and needing to
00:14:42.440 negate effects um I was really scared of
00:14:44.600 dweller all day and I never ran into it
00:14:47.360 but uh chalice would have been in my
00:14:49.199 main deck to stop that kind of stuff so
00:14:51.519 I was I don't think I would cut it I I
00:14:53.600 might cut one I think my my changes are
00:14:56.560 going to I'll talk about a little bit
00:14:57.959 actually and the the other card I played
00:14:59.360 was imperm this card sucked actually I
00:15:01.440 think this was the weakest card in my
00:15:02.800 main deck it was really bad um since
00:15:06.240 this was my only hand trap I ended up
00:15:09.560 holding it for my turn
00:15:12.639 anyway and even then I was just like
00:15:17.519 dang I wish this was chalice because I
00:15:19.440 have to start my turn with imperm and
00:15:22.000 there are just situations where you
00:15:23.320 would rather have chalice in your hand
00:15:25.000 to negate something in the middle of the
00:15:26.800 turn or or like droplet um um and it
00:15:30.279 just would be better if it wasn't imperm
00:15:32.279 I mean it's not like there were times
00:15:35.079 where I went first and I did my combo
00:15:36.959 and I drew into imperm and had like two
00:15:38.639 copies of it and it was fine it just it
00:15:41.160 could have been something else and it
00:15:42.839 would have performed a lot better I
00:15:44.560 think actually something I want to put
00:15:45.959 into the main deck of this depending on
00:15:47.759 how like Liss and age of Overlord look I
00:15:50.279 think Eclipse should be in this deck I'm
00:15:54.160 thinking more about it now and Eclipse
00:15:55.560 just seems like a type of card that
00:15:56.680 would be extremely strong because this
00:15:59.000 deck can clear boards really easily it
00:16:00.720 can make Zeus really easily and booking
00:16:03.279 all your opponent's monsters just feels
00:16:04.800 really good even though like cashier is
00:16:07.480 not in the format I I I don't know I
00:16:08.920 I'll test around with it but imperm I
00:16:11.560 don't think that card is very good this
00:16:13.079 format I was not impressed with this
00:16:14.560 card like I said I think it was the
00:16:15.680 weakest card in my main deck uh but the
00:16:18.319 strongest card in my main deck baby
00:16:20.120 that's right three skill drain uh this
00:16:24.000 card is phenomenal it is so good um it
00:16:30.120 was definitely the reason I won a lot of
00:16:32.800 my games I will not even front uh it was
00:16:35.800 very good I played against flu twice and
00:16:38.319 because this card was in my main deck it
00:16:40.240 was just it was incredible uh every time
00:16:43.360 I saw this card it was winning me the
00:16:45.560 game 100% of the time it's good against
00:16:47.639 pearly because you know the Noir is only
00:16:51.560 affected by activated effects so as soon
00:16:53.920 as you establish a skill drain the Noir
00:16:56.040 is just on you know it's it's effect is
00:16:58.199 negative
00:16:59.560 um this deck can play really well
00:17:01.399 through it because we play uh Citadel so
00:17:04.880 having Citadel that keeps floating means
00:17:07.119 you win the war of attrition every time
00:17:10.079 um this this card was awesome I I'm so
00:17:12.319 happy I decided to main it it was a
00:17:14.240 decision I made like the week before the
00:17:15.839 regional and I could not be more happy
00:17:17.959 with it I I probably will be playing
00:17:20.240 skill drain at three in every iteration
00:17:22.599 of Earth machine I come up with for the
00:17:24.720 the the foreseeable future because it
00:17:26.400 was just that good uh throughout the
00:17:28.160 tournament
00:17:30.440 um for extra deck that's a 40 card main
00:17:32.720 by the way um I don't want to go over 40
00:17:34.960 because I want my deck to be as
00:17:36.000 consistent as possible um and I want to
00:17:38.760 use my tunnel air effect to draw into
00:17:40.080 skill drain of course I'm just kidding
00:17:43.000 kind of not really uh okay so for the
00:17:45.039 extra deck it's three Goliath uh Best
00:17:48.120 Link one of the game and then one
00:17:50.679 ballista so ballista is your engine
00:17:53.640 piece to get you to box which gets you
00:17:55.400 to tunneler for your draw two but also
00:17:58.080 it's second effect is extremely relevant
00:18:01.559 a very very relevant effect that people
00:18:04.400 need to know about um is its attack
00:18:07.400 reduction okay so a lot of people refer
00:18:09.640 to the ballista attack reduction effect
00:18:11.600 as a secret effect it is not a secret
00:18:14.919 effect it is so just pivotal to your
00:18:17.960 game plan that you have to understand
00:18:20.760 that that is a win condition especially
00:18:22.440 with something like regulus another
00:18:24.280 reason I want to play three of this is
00:18:27.000 if you have regulus and you know you
00:18:29.159 have a play to get to ballista you
00:18:31.280 activate regulus targeting a machine you
00:18:34.320 summon the regulus the regulus puts the
00:18:36.679 machine in the spell trap zone which
00:18:39.080 gives you a spell trap Target for
00:18:40.760 ballista and then you can ballista pop
00:18:43.039 the machine that you summon with regula
00:18:44.679 or that you equip with regulus and then
00:18:46.960 you can go for Gustav and liba to swing
00:18:49.039 into the zero attack monster for 6,000
00:18:50.919 which is game so this card is super good
00:18:54.000 its attack reduction effect is part of
00:18:56.200 your main game plan do not consider
00:18:58.280 consider it a secret effect you should
00:18:59.799 be like constantly evaluating if you can
00:19:01.880 get game with ballista throughout uh
00:19:04.159 throughout your games that you play with
00:19:05.720 this
00:19:06.480 deck uh and then next up I played two
00:19:09.240 anger knuckle this you don't need to
00:19:11.919 play two I honestly didn't know what
00:19:13.840 else to include over the second anger
00:19:15.600 knuckle you can get away with one uh I
00:19:18.200 was worried about drol and lockb bird
00:19:20.240 banishing it and I wanted a second one
00:19:22.320 in the extra deck just in case but like
00:19:25.400 if I'm worried about DD Crow banishing
00:19:27.320 an extra Deck monster I probably should
00:19:28.799 have played a second river Stormer
00:19:30.360 instead because like that's really the
00:19:32.000 card that gets you to winning game
00:19:34.600 States in turn three and Beyond so I
00:19:36.919 don't know um it doesn't need to be too
00:19:39.760 angry knuckle I probably will switch it
00:19:41.159 for something I just didn't know what so
00:19:43.799 uh it never came up where I needed a
00:19:45.840 second one but it felt good having it I
00:19:47.720 guess I don't know not necessary though
00:19:50.360 um scrap wyvern card was awesome uh this
00:19:53.640 is your main playr D barrier so if you
00:19:57.200 do something like activate schedule you
00:20:00.200 go into recycler and Citadel and then
00:20:03.000 you use the wyvern effect to summon a
00:20:05.400 Scrap Monster In Your Grave which will
00:20:06.559 be the recycler which is an earth
00:20:07.840 machine and then destroy it and then
00:20:10.400 that triggers wyvern's second effect so
00:20:13.120 you go wyvern chain link one Citadel
00:20:15.159 chain link 2 and then the scrap wyvern
00:20:17.400 is chain blocked so uh that affects to
00:20:20.400 summon a scrap and Destroy summons from
00:20:22.440 deck so it is technically Ash but having
00:20:25.360 Citadel activate as chain link 2 Chain
00:20:27.760 blocks the wyvern uh and then you'll
00:20:29.960 just destroy a card it doesn't Target in
00:20:31.799 a new chain or anything like that it
00:20:33.360 just destroys a card on the field as
00:20:35.280 part of the effect so I caught a lot of
00:20:37.520 opponents off guard with that throughout
00:20:38.679 the tournament um really good card I'm
00:20:40.960 very thankful that I decided to play
00:20:42.400 scrap recycler instead of any of the
00:20:43.840 macka stuff because it gave me access to
00:20:45.919 this and this card was
00:20:47.240 amazing and then the last link monster
00:20:49.559 in the extra deck is one
00:20:52.159 lingaro uh it never came up throughout
00:20:54.440 the the regional but it has come up in
00:20:56.360 the past there's no reason not to play
00:20:58.679 it you have room in the extra deck if
00:21:00.799 you don't play it you're just opening up
00:21:03.559 a lose condition right so just play the
00:21:06.320 lingbo it's really good uh there you go
00:21:08.960 there's my PSA about lingo um so that's
00:21:11.600 it for the Link monsters and then I
00:21:15.120 played um One River Stormer this is your
00:21:18.919 main engine extra Deck monster it's very
00:21:21.279 good and then weird MVP of the
00:21:23.960 tournament was Mountain Smasher I ended
00:21:25.600 up making this card a ton so to explain
00:21:29.360 why having Mountain Smasher as part of
00:21:31.159 your turn one combo is so good because
00:21:33.640 if you do your full turn one combo and
00:21:35.360 if you add Mountain Smasher to
00:21:37.600 it you can and road roller is what
00:21:41.000 allows you to do that by the way um but
00:21:44.440 you can either Shuffle back the mountain
00:21:45.960 Smasher so you're shuffling back Goliath
00:21:47.799 Goliath Goliath ballista Mountain
00:21:49.240 Smasher which is five extra deck pieces
00:21:51.559 if your hand is lacking non-engine or
00:21:53.760 interruptions you can do that which will
00:21:56.440 uh you'll not Shuffle back a main deck
00:21:58.159 monster which will make it more likely
00:21:59.840 that you draw into a piece of non-engine
00:22:02.840 by shuffling back five extra cards or
00:22:05.480 you can what I did most of the time is
00:22:08.159 leave this in the
00:22:10.679 grave so if your grave is set up to look
00:22:13.000 like this where you have knuckle
00:22:14.799 Mountain Smasher and uh River Stormer in
00:22:17.880 it it turns any card in the game into
00:22:21.720 any Earth machine and what I mean by
00:22:24.240 that is anger Knuckles graveyard effect
00:22:26.480 is you can send a card from your hand or
00:22:27.679 field to the graveyard to special summon
00:22:29.039 it from the graveyard so let's pretend
00:22:30.240 this is my graveyard I am going to go
00:22:32.640 anger Knuckles effect summon
00:22:35.039 itself sending skild drain I will use
00:22:38.320 Mountain Smasher effect to Tribute anger
00:22:39.880 knuckle to summon it I will link off the
00:22:42.960 mountain Smasher for a copy
00:22:45.760 of Goliath I will use River stormers
00:22:48.799 effect tributing the Goliath to summon
00:22:50.360 itself and then I will use Goliath
00:22:53.240 effect to attach the river Stormer and
00:22:55.279 then I'll use the river Stormer to
00:22:56.559 search for any Earth machine in the the
00:22:58.120 game so without playing Road Roller
00:23:02.400 there really wasn't a consistent way to
00:23:04.720 get another infinite track exas in the
00:23:07.679 grave besides River Stormer and I know
00:23:10.559 some people are going to be like well
00:23:11.640 technically you could do Harvester
00:23:13.080 Target Fortress to get uh Earth slicer
00:23:17.159 and That Could set that up in the grave
00:23:18.600 but let's be honest that does not happen
00:23:20.440 every game um it it it's very
00:23:22.960 situational where that happens whereas
00:23:24.799 with uh including road roller you're
00:23:26.360 pretty much always making mountains
00:23:27.960 Mountain Smasher as part of the combo so
00:23:30.320 um I was really happy that I
00:23:32.799 included this card in the deck uh it it
00:23:36.000 was honestly like I said it was an MVP
00:23:38.799 it makes itself huge it makes it 31 so
00:23:41.320 it makes like it's very easy to run over
00:23:43.559 stuff and make Zeus if you need to do
00:23:45.679 that I don't know I was very impressed
00:23:48.559 with this card I will continue to play
00:23:50.159 it moving forward as as long as Road
00:23:51.720 rollers in the deck this card is going
00:23:52.760 to be in there too um I don't make any
00:23:55.279 way to make nines I I didn't
00:23:58.919 I understand that Earth slicer has the
00:24:00.279 interaction where you can blow up your
00:24:01.440 own cards to summon Citadel but scrap
00:24:05.159 Wyn is just kind of better in my opinion
00:24:08.400 um so I liked playing recycler and scrap
00:24:11.000 wver instead so I I didn't play any
00:24:12.520 nines so uh moving out of the 10 I
00:24:14.679 played a super Dora a goose Max and a
00:24:17.799 Leba um yeah there you go that's pretty
00:24:21.640 simple your main win condition there and
00:24:23.440 then my last extra Deck cards was two
00:24:25.039 copies of Zeus I still like two Zeus a
00:24:27.399 lot in this deck I know unicorn isn't
00:24:29.240 like that big of a deal anymore but two
00:24:31.760 Zeus allows you
00:24:33.399 to make Zeus in main phase one with
00:24:36.679 Harvester and a level 10 and then if you
00:24:39.919 get into a game state where you swing
00:24:41.919 with the Zeus and you know you can just
00:24:43.960 summon another one on top of it um or
00:24:46.000 you can I don't know just make two Zeus
00:24:48.640 throughout the game it's just it's just
00:24:49.880 a really good card in this deck Zeus has
00:24:52.080 a lot of uh good interaction like uh
00:24:55.399 Goliath attaches itself to any Machin ex
00:24:57.480 sees so Goliath can attach to Zeus you
00:25:00.279 can also um you can also regulus this is
00:25:05.159 a pretty neat interaction just how
00:25:07.360 explaining again how good of a card
00:25:08.640 regulus is you can also regulus activate
00:25:10.520 its effect uh targeting a Goliath to
00:25:13.480 equip to it and then if you have a Zeus
00:25:15.559 on board you'll regulus neate something
00:25:18.440 and the Goliath still treats itself as
00:25:20.200 being sent from field to grave so you
00:25:21.720 Goliath Target Zeus and attach to it in
00:25:23.720 that way so regulus just does a lot of
00:25:26.279 cool stuff and Zeus
00:25:28.360 also interacts very well with the deck
00:25:29.840 so people say like pearly is the best
00:25:31.520 Zeus deck uh no Earth machine is the
00:25:34.320 best Zeus deck
00:25:35.840 baby um so yeah uh definitely happy to
00:25:39.799 play two Zeus I made tuus I think three
00:25:42.960 matches out of the eight that I played
00:25:44.480 at the region so really
00:25:47.320 good um and then for the side deck this
00:25:49.799 was definitely the weakest part of my
00:25:52.080 deck building uh there were definitely
00:25:54.279 cards I should have played that would
00:25:55.799 probably would have made my run a a
00:25:57.720 little bit better but we'll we'll
00:25:59.159 discuss that in a sec we I played uh
00:26:01.960 three droll which was amazing I loved
00:26:05.399 having this in the side deck I played
00:26:06.880 three Crow this card was also very good
00:26:09.919 this won me a game against Unchained on
00:26:12.080 top of some other stuff um definitely
00:26:14.640 worthwhile it's also good against
00:26:16.559 pearly uh I played three Kaiju this one
00:26:18.919 was a weaker pick in my extra
00:26:21.240 deck um I don't know this card was like
00:26:24.159 fine it's good in
00:26:25.640 theory but it just never
00:26:29.320 really it just never really came up
00:26:31.520 where it was like the thing that was
00:26:32.960 helping me win the game to be honest I
00:26:35.480 think Nibiru it was a card that my deck
00:26:37.919 list was sorely lacking um yeah so I
00:26:41.039 don't know I might play the Kaiju in the
00:26:42.320 future but it it was I think if I put
00:26:45.039 something like eclipse in the main deck
00:26:46.399 I I won't need to depend on aiju but I
00:26:49.080 don't know also don't have I don't own
00:26:50.880 thrust so skill issue I guess uh I
00:26:53.520 played two duster in a lightning storm
00:26:55.520 just to have for backer removal oh
00:26:57.799 another thing that was was touchy is I
00:26:59.720 don't I don't have a good way to out
00:27:02.240 tikaboo in this list so that maybe these
00:27:07.520 should be some amount of cosmic Cyclone
00:27:09.320 or something like that I think thrust
00:27:11.000 really would be good because I could
00:27:12.200 thrust for duster if uh tikaboo was on
00:27:14.559 the board but um yeah no I I I didn't
00:27:17.240 have a lot of thankfully I dodged at all
00:27:19.240 tournament so that was
00:27:20.919 nice uh and
00:27:23.279 then this was definitely the weakest
00:27:25.520 card on my list I played an additional
00:27:27.600 Floodgate because I wanted to really
00:27:29.679 seal the deal going first but this was a
00:27:32.080 mistake I should not have played goes in
00:27:33.760 my side deck it just was not impactful
00:27:35.880 at all um in theory it's good against
00:27:39.520 things like Vanquish Soul or uh branded
00:27:42.919 Chimera that kind of stuff like there's
00:27:44.720 a lot of applications where it does come
00:27:46.640 up in theory but I think ciding it um I
00:27:50.279 should not have cided it I should have
00:27:53.399 this could have been Cosmic Cyclone this
00:27:54.799 could have been eclipse this could have
00:27:55.720 been anything really and I decided to
00:27:58.159 play another going first card which was
00:27:59.799 a bad choice I I should not have done
00:28:01.279 that so definitely a detriment to the
00:28:03.919 deck building there but you know that's
00:28:05.159 all part of learning and growing as a
00:28:06.360 player you figure out what was what you
00:28:08.799 did wrong when playing but also what you
00:28:10.559 did wrong when building your deck right
00:28:12.240 and I I think this tournament was really
00:28:14.360 good even though I did perform pretty
00:28:16.200 well uh 11th place is the highest uh
00:28:20.159 placement I've had at a higher tier
00:28:23.519 event um it's still important to say
00:28:26.080 like okay what did I do wrong you know
00:28:28.440 what was I doing wrong in deck building
00:28:29.760 what was I doing wrong in playing all
00:28:31.519 that kind of stuff so um yeah that's the
00:28:34.760 that's the deck main side extra um I was
00:28:39.080 really impressed with it I was impressed
00:28:41.240 that my own Theory with the whole scrap
00:28:44.159 recycler stuff paid off super well yeah
00:28:47.240 so with all that being said I appreciate
00:28:48.799 you all for watching hope you enjoy
