# https://www.youtube.com/watch/qzpycObiDJc

00:00:04.040 yo welcome back guys to a video with
00:00:06.319 some
00:00:07.400 commentary um you got my opponent's on
00:00:10.440 the right I think he's playing like
00:00:11.920 Horus some kind of Horus deck and then
00:00:14.400 you got me on the left playing branded
00:00:17.359 Chimera I'm big fan of that deck
00:00:19.960 honestly I haven't played it in a little
00:00:21.760 bit I've been playing purely so bouncing
00:00:24.359 back between Cur Le
00:00:27.240 and uh Brandon cra I don't know which
00:00:30.920 one I'm going to take to the ycs and
00:00:32.520 Indie I'll be going to that uh I might
00:00:35.160 just play a bunch of side events instead
00:00:37.399 of the instead of the main
00:00:40.160 event not too sure but if you guys see
00:00:43.399 me there feel free say
00:00:46.559 hi you see during the draw phase I got
00:00:50.079 my branded opening imped well I summoned
00:00:52.680 a Luber and it got imped so go into the
00:00:54.800 main phase I'm going to normal summon
00:00:56.559 sword knight sword Knight effect summon
00:00:58.440 bare foret bare foret effect
00:01:00.680 uh he's going to chain to the sword
00:01:02.120 Knight effect though the I whatever the
00:01:04.959 Horus trap is that special summons one
00:01:07.240 once per
00:01:08.320 chain per effect resolves so my the
00:01:12.200 Horus player my opponent obviously he
00:01:14.880 didn't have a whole lot going for him uh
00:01:17.759 on his turn he just set two and then
00:01:19.280 passed and then even on my turn he
00:01:20.880 summons like the worst horse monster so
00:01:23.960 I don't imagine this is going to be too
00:01:26.240 terribly hard to break my hand over
00:01:28.799 there looks pretty solid I think I have
00:01:31.520 gazelle um it looks like gazelle
00:01:35.399 Ash I think
00:01:37.640 cornfield or
00:01:40.119 codal going to activate the chamera
00:01:44.020 [Music]
00:01:45.119 fusion uh chin one gazelle in one of the
00:01:48.000 other videos I kept calling gazelle
00:01:49.360 Chimera that's definitely wrong
00:01:51.600 but uh gazelle chain link one chain link
00:01:55.439 2 bare fet targeting sword Knight chain
00:01:58.240 link three the cam here Fusion Monster
00:02:01.640 on board I do it that way so I chain
00:02:04.240 block the other two two
00:02:07.640 effects so searching
00:02:11.760 tow summoning sword knite back and then
00:02:14.000 everything's going to resolve so since
00:02:16.120 he's not chaining any of this stuff I'm
00:02:17.959 assuming he has no other Horus monsters
00:02:19.599 in hand and if that's the case then I
00:02:22.319 can also almost assume that he has
00:02:25.040 either hand traps or just dead cards in
00:02:26.879 his hand
00:02:30.280 so tack attacking over his monster and
00:02:32.319 then attacking for 19 directly with
00:02:33.760 sword
00:02:35.160 Knight and I mean I definitely have fair
00:02:38.360 amount of cards in hand but there's not
00:02:40.959 a whole lot else I'm going to do he
00:02:43.800 crowed my cam Fusion so I can't
00:02:45.480 necessarily get that
00:02:47.560 back I'm going to rip the talons out of
00:02:49.800 his hand for turn or for the end of the
00:02:52.040 turn and then he draws sets in his turn
00:02:55.560 still I'm going to activate sword Knight
00:02:56.840 effect sword Knight summon bare from
00:02:58.360 bare fromet effect
00:03:00.760 search two cards uh he's going to chain
00:03:02.920 to one of those effects summing out his
00:03:05.400 horse Monster again then I'm going to
00:03:07.200 draw for
00:03:08.080 turn honestly uh you guys hear me say it
00:03:10.959 in other videos people just need to
00:03:12.319 learn how to scoop like learn how to go
00:03:15.120 to the next game you're not going to win
00:03:17.360 them all and that's okay
00:03:20.239 but you know there there's some things
00:03:22.560 you can't control in this game but what
00:03:24.200 you can control is when you end the game
00:03:27.680 so like what I mean by that is sco up
00:03:30.080 and going to next game conserving
00:03:33.200 time like I think I have like seven
00:03:35.360 cards in hand or so this guy has three
00:03:37.319 cards on
00:03:38.480 board there yeah it's a rough situation
00:03:41.760 for him
00:03:43.519 but anyways going to activate poy going
00:03:46.599 into Guardian Cera going to pop two
00:03:48.360 cards on his
00:03:50.959 field pop two draw one bare for men
00:03:53.920 effect some back sword Knight
00:03:56.439 again he's going to call by the grave my
00:03:58.640 sword Knight
00:04:06.120 so draw two or Draw one pop the other
00:04:08.680 two cards on his field he's going to
00:04:10.480 reset the
00:04:14.400 Trap and I mean right here it it might
00:04:17.839 not be game immediately well hell it
00:04:21.238 actually might be but I'm going to
00:04:22.919 activate another Cham fusion and he
00:04:25.400 finally sees that you know there's no
00:04:27.080 other way he can win this so he's going
00:04:28.280 to scoop it up we're going to head right
00:04:29.600 into into the next
00:04:31.720 game here we are the start to game
00:04:34.160 number two my hand honestly it's good
00:04:37.680 but it's not that great against this
00:04:39.520 deck depending on what n board he goes
00:04:41.160 for I have a veiler and an imper and
00:04:43.600 hand and sometimes if they're going for
00:04:46.120 just like the straight up uh Horus lines
00:04:49.600 like they just want to summon four Horus
00:04:51.960 monsters on board then I don't think
00:04:55.080 failer especially is not the best cards
00:04:57.440 to you know have in your hand against
00:04:58.919 that board
00:05:00.639 but if he goes for like a zombie vampire
00:05:03.280 line or like a coach King bear the thing
00:05:06.160 that draws three then emper and failer
00:05:08.759 become a lot
00:05:09.919 better so mset discard the gizmek uh
00:05:13.919 search kingar draw a card I didn't see
00:05:16.400 what the other card in his graveyard was
00:05:18.720 but he summons happy summons MTI he's
00:05:21.880 going to use King arar effect
00:05:24.240 again sending the water horse
00:05:27.560 monster and then summoning it he's going
00:05:30.039 to activate gizmic effect banish I
00:05:33.199 believe it's eight cards I think banish
00:05:35.520 eight face
00:05:37.120 down summon itself he's going to use
00:05:40.080 that and the water horse monster going
00:05:42.440 into a zombie vampire
00:05:44.319 line now this is where the in my opinion
00:05:48.600 I should have well I guess I could have
00:05:51.160 used the the veiler in hand instead of
00:05:54.080 the empm but I'm sure I was probably
00:05:56.120 saving the saving the veiler for like a
00:05:59.120 guardian Camara
00:06:01.240 line just reading the king Ark right
00:06:04.000 here it has I know it has a protection
00:06:06.360 effect well it protects monsters um I
00:06:09.840 believe it's monster like Horus monsters
00:06:12.800 are unaffected by card effects that
00:06:14.479 don't Target and then zombie vampire
00:06:16.479 also has like one of those weird
00:06:17.840 protection effects I think it's
00:06:20.560 unaffected it might be unaffected from
00:06:23.120 Monster effects except those that are
00:06:24.759 summoned from grave it's something
00:06:26.960 really
00:06:28.039 weird but pretty unique to itself I'm
00:06:30.759 going to activate
00:06:31.880 codal and then just thinking what I want
00:06:34.160 here so going to add sword
00:06:36.680 Knight looks like I have a gazelle in
00:06:38.840 hand
00:06:39.440 [Music]
00:06:41.800 already so I I realistically have two
00:06:45.560 different normal summons in hand I have
00:06:47.080 sword Knight but I also have a uh I also
00:06:51.759 have a fall on of albas fall on of albas
00:06:54.160 could go into a uh mirror Jade the only
00:06:57.039 problem is that on the resol ution of it
00:07:00.240 he would get to add two cards from his
00:07:02.039 graveyard or banish to his
00:07:04.000 hand and he'd be able to send my mirade
00:07:06.680 which sending my Mir Jade's fine
00:07:09.840 but him adding two banish cards to hand
00:07:12.400 is what what really
00:07:17.479 sucks so
00:07:19.319 instead honestly this Line's pretty
00:07:21.319 solid I'm I'm not even going to lie this
00:07:23.160 this thing's kind of nice but col of abz
00:07:25.560 is going to use his happy because it's a
00:07:27.280 I think it's a beast Warrior and go into
00:07:29.000 riam and then M effect is going to send
00:07:31.319 the
00:07:33.319 rrum so it doesn't as far as I know he
00:07:36.720 doesn't really have any interruptions
00:07:38.319 left he has one card in hand I don't
00:07:40.039 think I know it at all but I have three
00:07:42.520 and I'm going to use Chimera Fusion
00:07:44.639 using the last two cards in my hand
00:07:47.520 which is bare and sword Knight to go
00:07:49.720 into a uh the Cima monster Cima Fusion
00:07:52.919 Monster and then on a new chain it's
00:07:54.840 going to be chain link one bare Target
00:07:56.479 sword Knight chain link 2 Chim monster
00:07:58.240 to rip that last card out of
00:08:00.280 [Music]
00:08:02.280 hand and it's going to be a bell
00:08:07.360 so I
00:08:09.319 don't not too sure why he oh I think
00:08:14.159 everything
00:08:18.879 resolved okay so I summoned the summon
00:08:22.319 the sword Knight
00:08:23.759 obviously and then I think I use Chimera
00:08:27.000 fusion and Grave effect to add back to
00:08:29.280 hand and I think he belled it I think
00:08:31.159 that's what it
00:08:32.799 was or maybe there's a little bit of
00:08:34.839 confusion here cuz it looks like I'm
00:08:36.159 explaining a bunch of stuff to him
00:08:38.719 either way I have a B on board now I'm
00:08:40.958 going to use Camara Fusion
00:08:43.750 [Music]
00:08:45.440 again so chain link one Guardian CRA and
00:08:48.240 then chain link 2 is going to be the
00:08:54.880 gazelle and he's just reading my cards
00:08:58.079 uh seeing what they do so so it looks
00:09:00.000 like I don't really have too much on
00:09:01.839 board right now um all I have is
00:09:04.079 Guardian Cima but I honestly I have a
00:09:05.720 lot of followup and
00:09:07.279 Grave which is really good and I have a
00:09:09.399 tow in hand which is even
00:09:12.000 better uh because so in grave I have
00:09:14.560 rrum effect and I can either summon rrum
00:09:18.399 or I
00:09:19.519 can uh or I can summon fall on vas and
00:09:23.920 and then Fusion off of that but I also
00:09:26.320 have the the Chimera monster Chim Fusion
00:09:32.360 Monster that can banish itself and then
00:09:34.399 someone one from grave so I definitely
00:09:36.560 have a lot of options here
00:09:42.750 [Music]
00:10:00.120 so activating the zombie vampire effect
00:10:02.680 we're both going to Mill four I don't
00:10:04.800 really I'm not Milling anything that's
00:10:06.880 worthwh he's going to summon an
00:10:11.279 alpha and bouncing my guardian CA it
00:10:14.079 doesn't Target as far I don't believe it
00:10:16.560 targets um and bouncing
00:10:28.320 itself and he's gonna activate a roochi
00:10:32.480 effect finishing another eight summoning
00:10:37.399 itself so right here I'm going to take a
00:10:39.880 lot of damage but I'm not going to
00:10:41.639 activate the so it's king of the Phantom
00:10:44.279 beasts not going to activate the effect
00:10:46.160 to banish itself to summon because I
00:10:48.959 want the body on board and I want to
00:10:50.440 keep the
00:10:52.160 body so it looks like it's going to pass
00:10:54.200 over to
00:10:56.120 me and then come here Fusion effects add
00:10:59.120 a back to
00:11:05.560 hand normal suon gel gazel effect I
00:11:08.399 think both of my bare FS are engraved so
00:11:10.079 the only thing I can really grab here is
00:11:11.519 a CH
00:11:12.880 Fusion which is fine I mean as long as I
00:11:16.120 have those in rotation somewhere whether
00:11:18.440 it be my hand deck or graveyard just
00:11:20.920 don't want them banished
00:11:23.310 [Music]
00:11:37.280 [Music]
00:11:43.740 [Music]
00:12:04.600 [Music]
00:12:08.760 so it looks like bunch of things going
00:12:10.360 down right now uh I believe I think I
00:12:13.560 destroyed the zombie vampire with my
00:12:16.800 guardian Chimera and I'm checking right
00:12:19.399 now I'm looking up
00:12:21.199 the uh looking up the effect of zombie
00:12:24.279 vampire to make sure that was legal and
00:12:26.440 it just says zombie vampire neither
00:12:28.240 player can Target this with uh with
00:12:30.639 effects of special sumon monsters except
00:12:33.120 those special summon from grave so since
00:12:35.079 Guardian CA does not Target it sounds
00:12:37.040 like that was a like it was a legal play
00:12:39.399 you can do that so just making sure I'm
00:12:41.760 not cheating you know which I do
00:12:44.760 remember this game now and I believe
00:12:47.680 when I made King of the flying or King
00:12:49.600 of the Phantom beasts the fusion I think
00:12:51.880 I used an illusion and like some other
00:12:54.519 Beast or something uh basically I don't
00:12:57.639 think I use the right right materials
00:13:00.279 for it and I realized it a little bit
00:13:02.480 later on in this match like sometime
00:13:04.120 around here uh and that's why I haven't
00:13:06.720 used the graveyard effect yet to summon
00:13:09.959 back cuz I'm
00:13:11.480 essentially I'm essentially pretending
00:13:13.480 like it's not even there because I don't
00:13:15.279 want to use like I don't want to use
00:13:17.160 resources that shouldn't be there um but
00:13:20.760 that's why you're not going to see me
00:13:22.279 use that for the rest of the game which
00:13:25.000 in my mind um if it was unwinable then I
00:13:28.880 would have just scooped it up G to game
00:13:30.560 three but I feel like here I can still
00:13:33.959 win this
00:13:35.399 game so right here what I'm checking for
00:13:38.519 is just seeing if I have another
00:13:39.639 Guardian Chimera or seeing like what
00:13:41.440 I've used in the extra
00:13:43.000 deck so I'm going to go into another
00:13:45.160 Guardian
00:13:48.120 camera use the
00:13:50.800 effects I believe I'm going to draw one
00:13:53.079 pop
00:13:54.600 two so popping the Richie popping the
00:13:57.160 alpha he's got one card in hand I have
00:13:59.480 Ash Blossom codal I think dark rer now
00:14:03.320 imperm he's going to set his trap pass
00:14:05.480 over to me I draw imperm Attack directly
00:14:07.639 with Guardian C I'm going to set the
00:14:09.120 imperm in his traps
00:14:12.399 column he's going to normal summon Ash
00:14:14.800 crash right into it I'm going to imperm
00:14:17.240 it that's going to begin broken imp
00:14:21.360 perming the ash insane all right guys
00:14:23.880 appreciate you for sticking to the end
00:14:25.680 uh that was a fairly quick one so see
00:14:28.240 you in the next one peace
