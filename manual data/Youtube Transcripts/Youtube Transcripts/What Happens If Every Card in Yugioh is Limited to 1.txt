# https://www.youtube.com/watch/ZDPdVrNCsxg

00:00:00.120 all right so every card is limited is
00:00:02.080 there still stuff that's banned when
00:00:03.760 these events happen it's almost like
00:00:05.799 they know which kind of cards are a
00:00:07.799 problem and they ban them for the events
00:00:10.200 like shifter and all that how does that
00:00:12.080 make sense like how do they realize that
00:00:14.360 these cards aren't fun but then uh
00:00:17.840 anyways all right what do we play that's
00:00:20.000 all my cards Dude maybe we take out the
00:00:21.920 runix it's a fun meme but if we take out
00:00:24.240 the runix we have room in the extra deck
00:00:25.880 for everything I never thought I would
00:00:27.640 say that
00:00:29.930 [Music]
00:00:34.559 that did not feel good Horus stuff dude
00:00:36.520 Horus with one MTI sounds miserable dude
00:00:38.960 this deck is
00:00:42.280 glorious broken you're so cracked out
00:00:45.039 here opening the one of yeah I know dude
00:00:47.360 my opponent opened five one ofs isn't
00:00:49.239 that crazy all right we can't lose
00:00:53.330 [Music]
00:00:55.920 uh
00:00:57.440 yes ah yeah the one of oh but you can't
00:01:00.480 search with this ever it's very funny
00:01:02.000 cuz you never have a second target
00:01:03.719 that's so bad if you join my stream
00:01:05.760 right now you have no idea if I'm
00:01:07.439 playing the event or not cuz you could
00:01:09.159 be seeing this exact board it'd be super
00:01:11.200 reasonable the opponents though yeah the
00:01:13.400 opponents one is hard to explain why are
00:01:15.119 they PL Pendulum In this event well I
00:01:16.640 mean I'm assuming because pendulum is
00:01:19.520 just a slob of pendulum cards and it
00:01:21.360 literally doesn't matter which ones you
00:01:22.799 have in your deck
00:01:30.280 that was
00:01:39.159 mean I told you we stay
00:01:41.860 [Music]
00:01:45.119 winning not even a problem dude is kid
00:01:48.719 colos on a Paleo just a free summon
00:01:51.200 because it can't get sent but you summon
00:01:53.280 first dude this deck is
00:01:58.840 broken I'm roll back I'm just going to
00:02:01.320 attack and keep metan noise and uh
00:02:03.200 Elemental burst for their turn there's
00:02:04.840 no way they can beat
00:02:12.720 that easy how can one deck be so based
00:02:16.160 and so broken at the same time how is it
00:02:21.319 possible I M lost wi that roll back dude

00:06:01.440 going to stop PE Rhino okay I see that

00:06:15.240 you keeping reinforce for I'm confusion
00:06:18.160 I'll just set these three and pass but
00:06:20.199 I'm going to use Nessie uh just to get
00:06:22.560 the Moth Man Out of the deck
00:06:27.240 well let's either mil seven or banish
00:06:30.000 their
00:06:31.720 graveyard dude they ashed Fe comedian

00:06:36.639 man how am I getting ashed in the limit
00:06:39.520 one Festival by the way I wanted to know
00:06:41.919 whether I was going to hit or not now
00:06:43.560 I'll never find
00:06:46.800 out wait why is it still negated oh is
00:06:49.919 that continuous I didn't know that okay
00:06:52.800 that's annoying that's very bad dude
00:06:55.039 what do I draw even I could draw seir oh
00:06:58.520 God fenry could also do it or tier limit
00:07:01.319 cash

00:07:12.440 snake eye combo all this time why didn't
00:07:14.720 you do it earlier what the hell not game
00:07:17.199 yet probably will be
00:07:19.280 though I love wanted such a
00:07:22.080 well-designed card that's not enough cuz
00:07:24.560 of the contain right we tried
00:07:31.000 don't dare me maybe I'll bring runic
00:07:32.919 tenpai to locals at some point just to
00:07:35.080 be annoying just to make a
00:07:37.520 statement how I've played against three
00:07:40.240 horror decks so far and they've all
00:07:42.400 opened sarcophagus or
00:07:53.360 insetti
00:07:55.080 why why did you do that I only opened
00:07:58.080 fenri imet a Bellar how am I going to
00:08:00.800 beat a trivia Karma dude this game is so
00:08:06.039 unfair the amount of Ashes I've seen in
00:08:09.199 this event is concerning dude through
00:08:12.159 Ash I like my
00:08:19.159 board look at these tryhards playing uh
00:08:22.319 rescue a sinful spoil in this event you
00:08:25.720 make me sick so I'm going to transaction
00:08:27.800 roll back Elemental burst you with Mario
00:08:30.360 64 music running is my way to deal with
00:08:32.719 it oh hydrant oh you're committing your
00:08:35.000 normal summon okay let me just burst
00:08:37.200 real
00:08:41.058 [Music]
00:08:47.550 [Laughter]
00:08:49.560 quick I don't have a target for scream
00:08:51.839 but it's still funny like the thing is
00:08:53.800 Hess is limited anyways so Milling Hess
00:08:56.279 is technically always the same level of
00:08:58.160 luck but in this event it feels feels
00:08:59.680 extra
00:09:02.440 [Music]
00:09:08.320 good I for one think Goblin biker should
00:09:11.120 get Poplar I think no one should get
00:09:13.560 Poplar from here on out I think cards
00:09:15.720 like Poplar promote very unhealthy one
00:09:17.800 card combos and no deck should have
00:09:19.440 those dude this deck I've thought about
00:09:21.600 it long and hard this deck cannot draw
00:09:23.600 bad hands it's not possible this deck
00:09:25.640 drawing a bad hand is as impossible as a
00:09:28.399 Horus deck not opening imet in this
00:09:31.760 event dude stop drawing all the one ofs
00:09:35.279 oh you had magnam anyways okay sick why
00:09:37.600 did they open magnut plus lelion against
00:09:40.079 my tier lament deck I'm confusion well

00:09:43.920 that's good
00:09:45.920 and okay yeah discard all the B deals

00:13:27.640 [Music]
00:13:32.519 what the hell is Potter Duality doing
00:13:34.320 here how do you pot Duality into a race
00:13:37.079 what kind of play is that can you
00:13:38.839 explain that technology to me
00:13:41.360 dude what is going
00:13:43.880 on oh
00:13:57.040 God yeah
00:14:00.959 oh we have we drew laundry Trap For the
00:14:02.920 First Time by the way the matches in
00:14:04.880 this event against all the diab belar
00:14:07.839 decks are a perfect explanation why
00:14:11.240 consistency hits are garbage because
00:14:13.320 this is going to be a completely normal
00:14:15.240 combo in an event where everything is
00:14:17.040 limited it's literally the best selling
00:14:19.399 point for never doing consistency hits
00:14:21.920 ever I'm sitting here my goofy ass
00:14:24.040 tierman Paleozoic deck and I'm being
00:14:26.079 full snake ey rescue a comboed right now
00:14:28.399 in a limit
00:14:29.639 Festival theoretically it's best to
00:14:32.600 click battle phase here from their
00:14:34.399 perspective they should just summon out
00:14:35.880 SP the problem is because evenly is
00:14:37.959 limited I don't know if they're going to
00:14:39.759 fall for it let's try
00:14:42.240 it yeah okay
00:15:03.720 wait they could just summon in battle
00:15:05.199 phase uh yeah you're right I forgot
00:15:08.079 about that too but so did they yeah they
00:15:10.880 could have just let me go battle phase
00:15:12.360 and then summon SP anyways moving on it
00:15:14.519 worked so it was
00:15:26.959 correct they're probably SP my kick Clos
00:15:30.319 which is not
00:15:31.759 good or just hand trap It Sick well we
00:15:36.000 can still go battle face if they want to
00:15:38.040 pop my kick Clos I still get to Mill not
00:15:40.399 that
00:15:43.959 bad linkaro doesn't really do anything
00:15:46.839 cuz we just attack it with the seamare
00:15:48.560 first that's
00:15:51.880 fine why does it feel like oh they only
00:15:54.399 pop that okay that's smart why does it
00:15:56.920 feel like I'm playing against the
00:15:58.560 complete completely normal snake ey deck
00:16:01.040 right now it's because consistency hits
00:16:02.759 are ass that's why well I have rise to
00:16:04.880 full height so I might survive but the
00:16:07.079 problem is the SP can stop me from using
00:16:11.120 that I think making mud dragon is worth
00:16:13.600 it hav this into mud dragon but then I
00:16:15.639 have to fuse my backjack away I want to
00:16:17.839 keep my backjack just for the chance
00:16:19.519 that it hits something
00:16:22.680 well sick
00:16:32.250 [Music]
00:17:15.199 this way I can save kolos for next
00:17:22.400 turn cuz I knew they were going to SP
00:17:25.400 the kolos so it's going to come back are
00:17:27.520 we doing limit one or rank just got here
00:17:29.600 it's funny you ask but this is the limit
00:17:32.000 one
00:17:35.530 [Music]
00:17:40.720 Festival who needs
00:17:45.320 coings I guess they wanted to bring back
00:17:48.200 St that's fine
00:18:02.120 wait which one did I Rise didn't I Rise
00:18:04.159 that one yeah you they rise the one that
00:18:06.480 they could
00:18:10.730 [Music]
00:18:17.520 attack if anyone ever asks you why
00:18:20.679 consistency hits are [ __ ] show him this
00:18:22.720 game
00:18:31.799 all right five spell traps six monsters
00:18:34.200 field spell turn three everything's
00:18:37.600 limited battle phase stare at Mela
00:18:40.360 wondering why you can't attack it we'll
00:18:42.120 never figure it out we'll report bug to
00:18:44.200 Konami we'll try to pop with zantis
00:19:38.460 [Music]
00:19:41.840 the fact that I'm losing is annoying
00:19:44.080 that's all I'll say what are the set
00:19:45.799 cards I for Gore there's probably rescue
00:19:48.240 a stuff right there's a rescue
00:20:03.600 I probably should have Dynam missous the
00:20:05.080 flamur maybe not
00:20:09.039 sure okay now you can't even attack the
