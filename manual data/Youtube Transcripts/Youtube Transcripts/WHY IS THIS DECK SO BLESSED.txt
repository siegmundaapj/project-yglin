00:00:00.080 I have a list open here of some dualist
00:00:03.120 cup top 100 Decks that you guys sent
00:00:05.440 over tier liament please dude there's no
00:00:08.280 way they actually got 11th in the world
00:00:10.519 with tier liament and they also played
00:00:12.400 tier liament really dude this is almost
00:00:15.160 the same list okay tier laments
00:00:18.160 strongest I guess we gamble a little
00:00:23.439 bit all right you know what yesterday
00:00:26.400 I've gotten Fen reared or unicorn every
00:00:29.160 single game I'm going to start
00:00:30.320 shotgunning my Maxis today oh no it's
00:00:32.800 ninjas out of all things that's probably
00:00:34.920 not going to special summon yep that's
00:00:36.960 what happens when I shotgun Maxi by the
00:00:40.640 way and we have defeated ninjas sick who
00:00:44.680 got first place in the dualist cup it
00:00:46.280 was Ryan you
00:00:48.640 again ooh that's a good hand Maxi Cooks
00:00:53.199 this it's not that bad really depends on
00:00:55.920 how we Mill but like okay they don't
00:00:57.920 have
00:00:58.920 it
00:01:00.800 okay we' oh my God we are so good at

00:01:04.360 how so we Mill
00:01:06.960 three we milled heartbeat and crime we
00:01:10.400 drew a rhino heart so we don't have to
00:01:12.040 search a rhino heart that's good this is
00:01:14.080 so criminal this deck shouldn't be doing
00:01:17.040 this but it does it every time to me as
00:01:19.320 well when I play against this it does
00:01:20.840 this [ __ ] all the
00:01:22.360 time yeah dude holy okay have I been
00:01:26.720 disregarding Tian strong all this time
00:01:29.240 dude if we win another game we're
00:01:30.560 already at the rankup game we just
00:01:31.960 started I hate that this is
00:01:34.360 working okay surely now someone can beat
00:01:37.240 us surely please kikan you can beat
00:01:41.650 [Music]
00:01:43.920 this all you need is another
00:01:48.159 starter dude it's strongest why is this
00:01:51.280 deck so blessed man what is the Set Card
00:01:54.280 anyways Scythe oh it could be Scythe I
00:01:57.479 might not even want to pop it Mill three
00:02:00.920 the strudle and tier cash one
00:02:04.719 haves two tier
00:02:08.239 cash wait it was called by the grave why
00:02:11.319 is there called by the grave in your
00:02:12.879 super heavy Samurai Deck dude we M
00:02:15.080 Sheran and shuffler oh my God this deck
00:02:17.440 is blessed this deck just can't lose
00:02:20.120 okay there's Maxi at least how easy is
00:02:22.200 it for me to just game them
00:02:24.200 here yeah
00:02:27.280 dude what was that deck even why was
00:02:29.680 there called by they couldn't even like
00:02:31.840 use the called by because if they do
00:02:34.000 they can't play
00:02:39.080 anymore my hand is four normal summons a
00:02:42.440 flamb bur and a dead trap card I
00:02:44.480 couldn't be happier right now I'm going
00:02:46.080 to delete this deck after this game I
00:02:48.080 don't know how the hell they got top 100
00:02:50.040 in dualist Cup this does not make any
00:02:55.380 [Music]
00:02:56.480 sense just draw better okay
00:03:00.480 I know you guys are making fun of it
00:03:01.800 right now but there is a solution for
00:03:03.239 this deck's problem and I'll show you
00:03:05.120 it's very simple you just do this and
00:03:07.239 then you just solve all the problems you
00:03:08.799 have with the deck your life is going to
00:03:10.080 be so much better and then you go into
00:03:12.000 ranked and you gamble with tier liament
00:03:14.319 see you win coin flips you draw broken
00:03:16.360 hands you Mill the nuts easy clap see
00:03:19.000 broken hand and now we gamble we mill
00:03:22.799 eight cards and we Ash their Maxi cuz we
00:03:25.640 don't agree with it oh never mind we
00:03:29.159 don't have a save in it if I chain tier
00:03:31.040 cash I only Mill six cards but they
00:03:32.640 don't get a draw I'll do it well we have
00:03:35.560 a shuffler and we mil this so we get a
00:03:38.920 what do we get probably metano it isn't
00:03:41.519 too bad it's not that bad we gave them
00:03:43.840 no draws we set to we can play on their
00:03:47.080 turn it's all right would be much worse
00:03:50.080 normal summon Poplar let's see what's in
00:03:52.360 the
00:03:54.599 box the box has a salx so we have a
00:03:57.599 Discord for super poly so what I'm
00:03:59.480 thinking is if I chain haves here I can
00:04:02.400 just get a discard for super poly if I
00:04:04.799 make kid colos later I can also Mill
00:04:07.200 three it's not worth it though is it if
00:04:09.720 I don't ah you know
00:04:12.159 what we get it
00:04:15.639 twisted well we have gotten it twisted
00:04:19.040 it's okay we got it's just a scream but
00:04:21.120 it gives us another discard it's okay
00:04:22.919 hey what do they
00:04:25.520 have oh they can link Kurio tribute to
00:04:28.919 kurara
00:04:30.919 that's what they have
00:04:34.919 okay uh don't think we need to kick Clos
00:04:37.759 here we still haven't hit snow by the
00:04:42.810 [Music]
00:04:56.919 way yep m
00:05:00.759 your Linker REO your wanted and your
00:05:04.280 this
00:05:12.360 thing easy clap not even close Max C
00:05:16.600 gamma plus combo not enough not enough
00:05:19.440 for tman strongest D we haven't lost for
00:05:21.759 T liament yet how this deck is not good
00:05:24.000 why does it win every time it just gets
00:05:26.120 it twisted somehow all the time all
00:05:28.160 right we go a second but it doesn't
00:05:29.319 matter because we have the heavens
00:05:31.000 mandate we nut draw anyways it doesn't
00:05:32.759 matter or opponent breaks or something
00:05:34.600 happens something crazy happens surely
00:05:37.039 yeah Maxi resolves
00:05:43.440 something see why is it t liament that's
00:05:46.360 just always lucky man dude
00:05:50.440 Zodiacs Dent
00:05:55.160 pass all
00:05:57.759 right and we top deck out for their Maxi
00:06:01.000 this deck is not real man the set is
00:06:03.039 macrocosmos that would break the
00:06:04.919 universe cuz they couldn't even give me
00:06:06.680 a hand to counter that there's no
00:06:08.919 possible hand I can draw to counter
00:06:11.560 that it is macrocosmos oh my god um yeah
00:06:16.919 we got cooked oh God the universe man
00:06:20.120 why does the universe play these games
00:06:21.840 with me Ash it now I'm not going to Ash
00:06:24.720 it it doesn't destroy it this is
00:06:26.360 basically aard oh yeah they've built
00:06:28.400 their own AR isard plus macrocosmos
00:06:34.080 right why did you let that happen you
00:06:37.000 could have just popped it all right well
00:06:38.840 p in hand
00:06:40.800 maybe not the case so we just draw a
00:06:44.479 heartbeat right right chat it's just
00:06:47.639 heartbeat always there's no way it's not
00:06:49.960 heartbeat
00:06:56.400 [Music]
00:06:58.520 okay
00:07:02.360 I can now special summon mudora which
00:07:04.879 means I can at least deal with the dren
00:07:06.720 right cuz I have two normal summons that
00:07:08.599 are bigger than it or two summons
00:07:14.240 rather please don't have whip
00:07:20.330 [Laughter]
00:07:25.919 tail dude no monster maybe come on all
00:07:29.720 hand
00:07:31.120 traps no how okay we can Ash it for one
00:07:34.360 turn but it stays on the field it's so
00:07:37.000 bad
00:07:38.039 man we're ashing I don't even know what
00:07:40.879 we draw that
00:07:49.000 helps that does not do
00:07:52.080 it
00:07:54.240 no dude we've drawn three Maxis by the
00:07:57.240 way there still is a universe where we
00:08:00.639 draw heartbeat send the Maxi to get rid
00:08:03.479 of the macro and then foolish make
00:08:05.599 something happen but we would have to
00:08:07.159 like foolish into tear cash and Mill
00:08:09.240 like crazy you're not even making like
00:08:11.400 Zeus or anything or like the thing that
00:08:13.919 pierces at least what are you doing you
00:08:17.360 lost your
00:08:20.000 mind why is this working why is this

00:08:47.839 deck yeah and I banished the fen reer
00:08:49.279 now so both of those are not outs

00:13:13.199 we lose again until the Gamba machine
00:13:15.160 breaks cuz I'm afraid I'm going to get
00:13:17.880 addicted okay this might be the one this
00:13:20.399 might be the one although we do have
00:13:21.519 super poon talents going second we'll
00:13:23.399 see they M ah they M good they Mill
00:13:26.240 metan noise and heartbeat together so
00:13:28.440 they get that yeah no matter who wins
00:13:30.839 cament is going to remain strongest
00:13:32.639 after this okay that was a not a great
00:13:34.920 Mill the crime now Mill 8 feel great
00:13:38.120 trivy
00:13:39.680 Karma solic Scream the scream doesn't
00:13:43.399 have a Target probably yeah let's hope
00:13:45.519 they don't make freaking dweller I'm
00:13:47.199 going to be pissed if they do that they
00:13:48.760 have both shufflers I'm in so much pain
00:13:51.720 okay it's a redoer they are not gambling
00:13:54.120 right I feel like I guess double
00:13:55.600 shuffler is pretty good against us but
00:13:57.320 the gambling so far hasn't been on the
00:13:59.279 best level you can definitely gamble
00:14:01.160 better than this I feel like I think
00:14:02.880 you're being weak right now I can just
00:14:05.120 super poly into kid clothes by the way
00:14:07.160 their Scream is live anyways so I might
00:14:09.600 as well start with a race and see what
00:14:14.560 happens that's what happens okay cool is
00:14:18.440 there a world where I can go for a game
00:14:20.480 it's probably not going to work but I
00:14:22.000 feel like I have to I mean I have a lot
00:14:24.399 of gas here I can maybe even go for
00:14:27.399 another Punisher line let let's start
00:14:29.399 with venir let's see if they dare to use
00:14:31.320 scream anyways they do okay that makes
00:14:34.160 them decking them out a little bit more
00:14:35.560 realistic let's see what happens I mean
00:14:38.199 they have two shufflers though it might
00:14:40.440 actually be Punisher because if I have
00:14:43.680 the ability to go I pay 4,000 for the
00:14:47.120 strudle if I pay 1,000 for the banish
00:14:49.839 effect my Punisher is going to gain
00:14:51.759 5,000 so that's going to be
00:14:53.839 8,500 I'm not sure if scream reduces
00:14:56.279 Punisher but that would still be 8K I
00:14:58.160 think that is the win condition which
00:15:00.120 isn't that unrealistic I don't think we
00:15:02.839 can deck them out though under double
00:15:04.160 shuffler I don't think that can be the
00:15:05.720 win condition it has to be some some
00:15:08.360 cheeky un aure line that is what it has
00:15:11.160 to
00:15:14.759 be oh uh
00:15:18.560 interesting question
00:15:21.560 mark hold up that should be it no take
00:15:25.800 rule close normal Rhino special Sharon
00:15:29.000 the trudo from hand that's level 11 hold
00:15:37.840 [Music]
00:15:57.920 up
00:16:01.040 easy clap yo we're addicted to tier
00:16:03.120 liament let's go oh this hand sucks we
00:16:05.680 just activate this banish soic
00:16:10.959 go a rhino heart Mill would have been so
00:16:14.000 much better with solic a that's annoying
00:16:17.440 my thought process was if I don't hit
00:16:19.680 then having the meta noise would be way
00:16:21.440 better I didn't think big enough it's my
00:16:23.360 bad I didn't understand the ways of this

00:17:41.880 would never believe that we would get to
00:17:44.520 this point after seeing the opening hand

00:18:20.600 the fenri and The Tear cash is the fen
00:18:22.679 reer dumb does the fen reer not know
00:18:24.600 that the Tan's cash is the only target
00:18:26.640 for it oh my God a
00:18:30.919 invoked they eyes enjoy your food the
00:18:34.679 only way that this deck can apparently
00:18:37.720 lose games is by getting paired against
00:18:40.600 the most confused stuff out there
00:18:43.799 because then apparently the universe
00:18:45.720 gives them macrocosmos or whatever this
00:18:48.360 is the Trap card it's just the Trap card
00:18:51.520 never mind they're playing lore accurate

00:20:09.799 hell is their deck why did they draw so
00:20:11.480 well there's no way their deck should

00:20:29.000 can't die the only thing is I have no
00:20:30.520 idea if I can select the seven person
00:20:32.200 snow fast enough I think I would
00:20:33.679 literally just select the first seven
