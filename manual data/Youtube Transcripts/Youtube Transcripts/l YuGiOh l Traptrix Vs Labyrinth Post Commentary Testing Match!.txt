00:00:00.240 what is good everybody welcome back to
00:00:01.920 team CLG here and today guys we're
00:00:03.360 coming with a post commentary dual video
00:00:05.759 featuring the new trap tricks that just
00:00:07.259 received an awesome structure deck
00:00:08.400 versus Labyrinth one of the projected
00:00:10.980 control decks of the format that's
00:00:13.259 supposed to be really good I actually so
00:00:14.580 to be honest with you guys this is like
00:00:16.199 for me watching paint dry I hate purple
00:00:18.240 cards every purple card I play it's
00:00:20.160 either an in perm or it's a brick and
00:00:22.380 the fact that all these decks are
00:00:23.580 practically playing so many purple cards
00:00:25.560 this is gonna be kind of boring for me
00:00:27.480 but you know what I figured we'll bring
00:00:28.500 a post commentary duel video but trap
00:00:30.240 tricks player ended up normal summoning
00:00:31.679 I don't even know what that is mantis
00:00:32.880 mantis into Sarah which is one of the
00:00:34.680 most busted busted link fours I have
00:00:37.440 link fours link ones I have ever seen in
00:00:39.600 my life like talk about a really insane
00:00:42.300 card but parallel is gonna fire off
00:00:43.620 which pretty much means he's going to
00:00:44.640 get reflation and that's one thing cool
00:00:46.440 about this trap trick strategy is that
00:00:48.719 it's kind of like a mix right so like
00:00:50.340 even if he doesn't open with a bunch of
00:00:52.020 purple cards reflation becomes a purple
00:00:54.539 card and reflation is actually quite
00:00:56.520 crazy it makes all your trap tricks
00:00:58.020 unaffected by trap effects and like
00:00:59.340 can't be destroyed by battle card effect
00:01:00.739 it's really kind of insane and I had
00:01:04.739 pretty good so far just been very
00:01:06.299 fortunate with like testing against
00:01:07.500 these matchups against my two buddies
00:01:08.700 here and I've just been able to kind of
00:01:09.960 like
00:01:10.680 open the stones or just be able to kind
00:01:13.020 of like open just really good and be
00:01:14.700 able to out resource them but for the
00:01:16.619 most part these decks are very very
00:01:18.240 scary like even right here setting for
00:01:19.680 like this is insane
00:01:21.180 uh like this is scary like I would be
00:01:23.100 praying for dust or lightning storm
00:01:24.360 because what these decks do is actually
00:01:26.580 quite quite crazy especially the
00:01:28.619 Labyrinth when you think about it I
00:01:29.820 don't I don't know a lot about Labyrinth
00:01:31.140 but here is welcome Labyrinth with
00:01:32.520 lesbian specials one from the deck and
00:01:34.619 this is where some crazy stuff happens
00:01:36.119 since a normal trap is activated the
00:01:38.400 Trap chick Sarah gets to trigger and
00:01:39.780 summon one from the deck so this is
00:01:42.240 probably the most interactive control
00:01:44.400 deck that I even know about I don't know
00:01:46.140 what this card is he just summoned but
00:01:47.400 it's probably my favorite one uh because
00:01:49.740 of just its art style like this art is
00:01:51.720 so so beautiful I just think that it is
00:01:54.600 a beautiful beautiful but we're gonna
00:01:57.360 see skill drain on resolution Unga Bunga
00:01:59.640 Yu-Gi-Oh but I think reflation makes
00:02:01.920 everything unaffected which is actually
00:02:04.939 insane if you think about it because as
00:02:07.200 long as we're flacia does not use its
00:02:08.520 effect to make its effect be a trap it
00:02:11.640 is has that effect where all like trap
00:02:13.200 tricks are unaffected by trap effects so
00:02:14.700 like
00:02:16.200 that's not good I I can see like of
00:02:18.239 course I can see the Labyrinth player my
00:02:19.319 man Jason thinking that would be good
00:02:20.819 but I mean like who would think like
00:02:22.440 refleisure could do that like I had to
00:02:24.480 read this card and I maybe I even read
00:02:26.040 it wrong maybe all three of us right
00:02:27.660 along well all three idiots I mean like
00:02:29.220 three we can't really read right
00:02:31.200 but from when I read it it just
00:02:32.819 literally says that this card literally
00:02:35.520 says that trap tricks are unaffected by
00:02:37.500 trap effects which means like
00:02:39.720 he just kind of skill drained himself in
00:02:41.340 a way
00:02:42.180 but we're gonna see another welcome
00:02:43.440 labret and then what's gonna happen here
00:02:46.140 is we're gonna have like kind of like a
00:02:47.220 little miscommunication happen he's he's
00:02:48.959 my man Caleb was saying here the
00:02:50.400 traffic's player he's going to flip
00:02:51.540 torrential on the summon of the monster
00:02:55.080 and uh
00:02:56.640 so there's a little bit of confusion
00:02:57.959 right now but I believe this is how this
00:02:59.519 would work if you guys know below so he
00:03:01.560 summons this monster here he declares
00:03:03.239 the effect this is where he like he
00:03:04.860 preemptively activated torrential
00:03:06.180 tribute right
00:03:07.319 probably would have mattered uh since he
00:03:09.959 if he would have held on like he could
00:03:11.280 have he could have had elaborate that
00:03:12.720 another monster than torrential but I
00:03:14.220 believe since he preemptively flipped
00:03:16.019 the torrential my man Jason has the
00:03:17.879 ability here to summon out this thing uh
00:03:19.620 trential is going to resolve the um the
00:03:22.860 tarantula is going to end up resolving
00:03:24.000 destroying everything and then the car
00:03:26.159 he summons its effect to add a labyrinth
00:03:28.260 monster elaborate the Trap card is going
00:03:30.120 to resolve because it's not going to be
00:03:31.319 on field to be affected by skill drain
00:03:33.060 and as you guys would see here he tried
00:03:35.099 to flip over um and then of course trap
00:03:36.599 chicks are an effect about trap effects
00:03:37.800 because of a flagship so torrential
00:03:38.819 doesn't affect them uh we're gonna see
00:03:40.739 he tried to strike but it was just like
00:03:42.000 a little bit of miscommunication
00:03:42.900 happening so he's going to get the ad of
00:03:45.180 big welcome Labyrinth I believe that's
00:03:46.680 what it is from the little level four
00:03:48.180 fiend that he summoned because it's not
00:03:49.680 on the field if that is not if that is
00:03:51.659 not correct guys please comment down
00:03:52.920 below and let us know like I said this
00:03:53.940 is a testing match so this is more like
00:03:55.319 literally my man built trap tricks right
00:03:57.540 here and my buddy is still testing
00:03:59.879 Labyrinth
00:04:01.200 as well so like and both these guys are
00:04:03.480 pretty combo players so it's actually
00:04:04.560 really interesting to see this because
00:04:06.000 they're both combo players playing like
00:04:07.620 very controlled strategies so it's just
00:04:09.720 interest you know it's a different pace
00:04:11.580 a different type of interaction like if
00:04:13.019 you I really wouldn't believe like this
00:04:14.879 like a control decks like this would
00:04:17.100 have this much interaction with each
00:04:18.358 other talk about like a very grindy
00:04:21.060 grinding game here uh here is Big
00:04:23.580 welcome Labyrinth I believe which was
00:04:25.380 born from the graveyard back out this
00:04:28.440 the the knighted ladies what I'm gonna
00:04:30.180 call her she's going to be um lost wind
00:04:31.919 and she's skilled rain right now is
00:04:33.479 affecting him like I think this card has
00:04:34.860 like a protection if it wasn't skill
00:04:36.419 drained but lost win and we're just
00:04:38.400 gonna wrap it up and go into game two uh
00:04:40.080 the Trap chicks player being able to
00:04:41.699 like still get his effects in the
00:04:43.199 simplified game state was actually
00:04:44.400 pretty big
00:04:45.660 so into that all important game number
00:04:47.940 two it could be either a 2-0 sweep from
00:04:50.759 the trap tricks player and you guys
00:04:52.380 don't know you guys can check the time
00:04:53.639 right now and say dang we have quite a
00:04:54.960 long time to go but since this is
00:04:56.759 literally like flip-flop bibbity Bop
00:04:58.860 this could just be a very long game too
00:05:01.080 you don't know no but just gotta stick
00:05:03.300 around and find out but I'd like to take
00:05:04.560 this time to go and thank our sponsors
00:05:05.820 for the channel Imperium duels check out
00:05:07.860 their website down below if you guys
00:05:09.300 like their sleeves their mats they're
00:05:10.919 you know I'm a huge advocate for them
00:05:12.600 use our code clg5 to get five percent
00:05:14.220 off your order down below and uh yeah
00:05:17.400 other than that if you guys are also
00:05:18.780 like And subscribe I do believe I'm
00:05:19.979 gonna all reopen memberships here soon
00:05:21.479 uh since I'm actually going to be
00:05:22.680 getting back into the uh
00:05:24.660 the gist of things here with uploading
00:05:26.460 and to just be able to produce content a
00:05:28.440 little bit more frequently than you know
00:05:30.000 everything happening uh life is actually
00:05:32.460 kind of slowing down we're going to see
00:05:33.900 an evenly matched uh talk about evenly
00:05:36.539 that structure deck that literally lets
00:05:38.880 everybody get an evenly pretty good I
00:05:40.860 need to go buy three of them and I hate
00:05:42.300 traps but evenly it's too good not to
00:05:44.100 have
00:05:44.759 for like the price that you know for 10
00:05:47.340 bucks that's just kind of crazy I wonder
00:05:48.900 I wonder maybe on TCGplayer which
00:05:50.759 especially if you guys plan on buying
00:05:52.800 any cards use my TCGplayer affiliate
00:05:54.780 link down below as well give a little
00:05:56.280 kick back to the channel I would like to
00:05:57.539 go on to TCGplayer and see if maybe like
00:05:59.340 that's the cost of structure deck right
00:06:00.900 like is the evenly like worth as much as
00:06:03.419 the structure but trap trick Sarah is
00:06:06.060 going to activate and that is going to
00:06:08.940 end up
00:06:10.320 doing some crazy stuff but since a
00:06:11.820 normal trap was activated evenly matched
00:06:13.560 he gets to summon out this I don't even
00:06:15.720 know this guy this this card's name but
00:06:17.220 it is by far my favorite Labyrinth card
00:06:18.900 just for her artwork and so this is
00:06:22.440 pretty crazy right here so he got evenly
00:06:23.880 set two and then this big old knighted
00:06:26.520 mama's gonna pop down she's gonna go to
00:06:28.500 the offensive here and I believe uh
00:06:31.740 she's just gone to she's 3 000 attack I
00:06:33.960 believe
00:06:34.740 and he's gonna go and activate this this
00:06:36.360 is like one of the new cards he gets to
00:06:37.860 discard a card I believe no no he
00:06:39.960 doesn't this is it can activate it can
00:06:41.759 activate the turn it's set and then if
00:06:43.860 you discard a car but if it's set a turn
00:06:45.300 it just summons itself like shade
00:06:46.319 brigadine
00:06:47.400 I believe uh don't quote me on it like I
00:06:49.080 said I'm not too fluent with these trap
00:06:50.160 Trick cards or anything but since the
00:06:51.419 Trap car was activated I believe she
00:06:52.919 gets the ability to chain and set a
00:06:54.240 labyrinth card from the deck so like
00:06:56.400 we're we're very much like now card
00:06:58.500 resources if you think about it I don't
00:06:59.880 I think both players have like three
00:07:01.020 cards in hand they now have the same
00:07:02.699 amount of cards on field
00:07:03.960 as far as resource goes
00:07:06.060 we're going pretty good but I forgot the
00:07:07.800 Sarah since a chapter trap card is like
00:07:09.600 triggering uh he she gets to summon from
00:07:12.060 the deck and marmello and I believe
00:07:13.259 marmello
00:07:14.759 I think that's right marmello I'm good
00:07:16.800 anyway uh it is a mandatory trigger so
00:07:19.560 uh he's going to go ahead and unchain
00:07:21.599 the the dogmatic punishment which is
00:07:24.060 being targeted by the marmello and to
00:07:26.340 send intus to attempt to destroy the
00:07:28.259 marmello and then he's going to go ahead
00:07:29.880 and Grave Diggers the intus effect and
00:07:31.500 kind of like protect stuff but this is
00:07:32.880 where he's dealing 2000 damage to the
00:07:34.680 Labyrinth player this might actually uh
00:07:39.300 be like the winning thing like the like
00:07:41.099 the so now resources are not so good
00:07:43.259 right the Labyrinth player has the
00:07:44.340 bigger monster we know that he got big
00:07:46.560 welcome Labyrinth I believe or another
00:07:47.819 Labyrinth card and he's getting to set
00:07:49.680 one and special out another Mama another
00:07:52.620 night at mama here so this is not
00:07:54.660 looking too good for the Trap trick
00:07:56.340 player but
00:07:57.720 normal summon of Dinaya I think that's
00:08:00.479 not what that one is do not quote me on
00:08:02.460 it uh that's gone to
00:08:05.699 I don't I truly don't oh yeah with the
00:08:07.440 special summons yeah okay so
00:08:09.780 he's gonna attempt to compulse here I
00:08:11.580 believe his own monster right no he gets
00:08:13.800 the compost and chain that's right uh
00:08:15.360 the one to set so he's just I think the
00:08:17.039 Labyrinth was just able to out resource
00:08:19.620 possibly I don't know uh these trap
00:08:21.539 check cards are kind of nutty when you
00:08:22.919 really stop and think about it so maybe
00:08:24.599 out resource the Trap tricks here just
00:08:26.220 by being able to like I feel like this
00:08:28.440 is where the control the monkey flip
00:08:30.539 stuff kind of gets to be a little bit
00:08:31.860 more like a caesar from Planet of the
00:08:33.539 Apes monkey because like you do have to
00:08:36.120 like play a resource management here
00:08:37.559 especially since like you're drawing
00:08:39.299 your disruptions you have to like use
00:08:40.919 node win to get your disruption have the
00:08:42.599 monsters that fetch you those
00:08:43.620 disruptions and stuff like that so it's
00:08:45.480 really a control match in the sense of a
00:08:48.060 Grind game but I believe that we're just
00:08:51.120 gonna go ahead yep we go ahead and
00:08:52.140 defeat here the Trap chicks player
00:08:53.580 realizing he's losing here going into
00:08:55.680 the all-important game at number three
00:08:57.720 and as you guys can see if you guys are
00:08:59.640 checking the time of the video this is a
00:09:01.620 very very long
00:09:04.019 game three I I might end up putting just
00:09:06.779 elevator music on here and just
00:09:08.640 literally letting it go out but we're
00:09:10.140 going to see in perm smack that marmello
00:09:12.660 I think that's the neighbor called
00:09:13.620 marshmallow that's a good name
00:09:15.260 marshmallows getting smacked with
00:09:16.800 imprint frame one but that's okay it'll
00:09:18.240 turn into Sarah
00:09:19.560 and then this is a new car from the
00:09:21.000 structure deck it's a quick effect
00:09:22.740 special summon that lets a special
00:09:24.839 summon it from the hand and then when a
00:09:27.959 special ones from the hand it protects
00:09:28.980 the back row which is really good
00:09:31.140 searching out that new trap hole card
00:09:32.760 which is the one that's like the shaping
00:09:34.080 and Dean activating it discarding evenly
00:09:36.060 at a special summon interesting that
00:09:38.700 evenly is still in the I guess maybe
00:09:40.680 this is like one of the control
00:09:41.580 strategies like you cite in evenlys
00:09:43.200 because like a well-timed evenly can
00:09:44.880 just blow out your opponent and we're
00:09:46.440 gonna see a rank four and two reflation
00:09:48.360 holding it down we actually see but we
00:09:50.820 have two cards left in hand interesting
00:09:54.120 he didn't set it
00:09:56.040 again maybe this is part of the control
00:09:57.540 and Resource Management firing off the
00:09:59.940 pot of prosperity to be able to banish I
00:10:02.760 believe three did he three will find out
00:10:04.860 or six I believe I can't remember one
00:10:06.660 two three four fives okay he must have
00:10:09.360 managed six and he is going to those
00:10:11.459 that's a lot of purple there a lot of
00:10:13.140 good cards the strike punishment
00:10:15.300 ice dragons prison compuls evenly itself
00:10:17.880 in a pot of so we're gonna grab the
00:10:19.680 evenly
00:10:21.320 interesting very interesting so frame
00:10:24.600 one he grabs evenly and we're going to
00:10:26.160 see a set four
00:10:28.620 and a pass
00:10:31.620 I mean if you have if he has welcome
00:10:33.300 Labyrinth that'll just grab him and
00:10:34.800 there that's big welcome Labyrinth
00:10:37.320 see I don't even know what they like
00:10:38.519 what these cards I don't know what these
00:10:39.839 cars actually do they go to them
00:10:41.160 especially from the graveyard and the
00:10:42.720 deck so like there's both I assume both
00:10:44.279 traps summon from deck
00:10:46.740 uh it must add it to hand
00:10:48.600 so I must add it to hand but that's
00:10:49.980 going to trigger Sarah to summon out the
00:10:51.839 marshmallow which is going to attempt to
00:10:54.120 pop a mandatory trigger to pop he's
00:10:56.279 going to chain punishment
00:10:58.019 to uh
00:11:00.360 but I don't think punishment can work
00:11:02.339 there you know I think
00:11:04.079 punishment can't work here right because
00:11:05.820 of the Trap tricks card the refliger
00:11:07.560 says they can't Target if I remember
00:11:09.180 correctly or they're just unaffected by
00:11:11.279 trap effects but I guess that doesn't
00:11:13.079 prevent him from targeting right so like
00:11:15.060 he can still attempt to Target it's
00:11:16.680 unaffected
00:11:18.660 but I wonder if like the The Punishment
00:11:21.240 No sees the attack because you have to
00:11:23.100 send something
00:11:24.360 I don't know another question for you uh
00:11:26.640 interesting people down below I've been
00:11:28.260 out of the game just getting back into
00:11:30.000 it for far too long to be honestly but
00:11:31.260 he's going to send the Gerudo to be able
00:11:32.519 to draw a card and uh to give him an
00:11:34.680 extra that's actually pretty good I mean
00:11:35.820 if it works that way that's really good
00:11:37.140 if it doesn't it doesn't he's going to
00:11:38.940 search for the shade bringing trap he's
00:11:40.740 going to go ahead and it's going to set
00:11:41.880 itself
00:11:43.560 and then he's going to normal summon
00:11:45.060 mantasy I know mantis I recognize mantis
00:11:47.040 anywhere
00:11:48.060 the Mantis is going to grab the new lady
00:11:50.040 trap tricks watch him I call it that is
00:11:51.660 going to be able to special summon
00:11:52.860 itself quick effect and protect the back
00:11:54.540 row while it's down but we're going to
00:11:56.279 see a Rank 4 into this trap tricks po I
00:12:00.720 just I didn't get to see the name of it
00:12:02.279 this is a newish card I believe at least
00:12:04.800 it's new to me I actually do not have
00:12:06.959 any idea what it does
00:12:09.360 uh there's just a lot of trap Trick
00:12:11.640 cards like when you stop and think about
00:12:12.720 it refleiger is like the most popular
00:12:13.860 Sarah's actually probably next there and
00:12:15.600 then after that it's that there's like a
00:12:17.220 there's like two or three more xyz's
00:12:19.440 like that's kind of crazy like three
00:12:20.940 links a link
00:12:22.440 two and a link three quite nuts uh big
00:12:25.260 welcome's gonna come out we're going to
00:12:26.519 see a chain real quick on the reflation
00:12:28.320 which is very interesting because now
00:12:29.579 that's going to make its effect be the
00:12:31.800 effect of what it sends
00:12:33.420 and that's going to
00:12:36.360 make any if he has another punishment
00:12:38.220 set that's gonna make that live we're
00:12:39.420 gonna see The Floodgate trap hole on the
00:12:41.459 summon of the night hid mama here and
00:12:43.680 the 19 mom is going to get flipped face
00:12:45.660 down
00:12:47.519 and
00:12:48.899 wow okay so that was kind of interactive
00:12:50.880 I don't actually totally do not know
00:12:52.440 which whose turn it is here but another
00:12:54.240 night at Mama from the hand you can't
00:12:55.860 stop the night of mamas but as so it
00:12:58.380 must have been that must have been his
00:12:59.519 turn and then now we're into the
00:13:01.019 Labyrinth player's turn actually I
00:13:02.700 remember when we were playing this so
00:13:04.260 much stuff was going on during like the
00:13:06.660 battle phase in one of these matches
00:13:07.800 that my buddy was like whose turn is it
00:13:09.720 like we're like it's your turn you into
00:13:11.760 battle and he's like oh my God I totally
00:13:13.740 just forgot what turn it was
00:13:15.420 but the big mama's gonna go to the
00:13:17.579 attack mode I shouldn't say big the
00:13:18.899 Knight of Mama I'm gonna attempt to
00:13:20.399 swing into Sarah
00:13:22.980 to deal damage they can't be destroyed
00:13:24.779 by battle but I mean like that's a 3 000
00:13:26.459 beat sticking too so we're taking 22
00:13:27.959 which is I mean like in these testing
00:13:29.940 matches we're not really holding too
00:13:31.380 close to life you know or not life but
00:13:33.000 to time because of the like it's time
00:13:35.519 right like times are times are times a
00:13:37.860  we already hate time as it is at
00:13:39.360 the time rules already suck so like this
00:13:40.920 is just for quality testing however
00:13:42.899 ironically you know if you get to the
00:13:44.639 point of like as you guys will see we'll
00:13:46.260 get to like a 40 minute Mark I know you
00:13:48.420 guys won't see but we'll have a 40
00:13:49.560 minute mark
00:13:51.000 and uh the the technically the game
00:13:52.980 should be called them but this is for
00:13:55.019 like this like I said testing match
00:13:57.200 t-e-s-t-i-n-g so like please comment
00:13:59.399 section don't try to come on glued on
00:14:01.079 these guys and in their entire careers
00:14:03.240 before they even start this is the
00:14:04.500 reason I put the in the title it's
00:14:05.820 testing because like people are still
00:14:07.620 learning learning the decks and learning
00:14:09.660 how to play it uh we're going to see
00:14:12.540 the almighty uh trap tricks fade Phantom
00:14:16.019 Knights of Shea branding activate here
00:14:17.279 I'd be able to summon itself as a
00:14:19.139 monster that's going to trigger the
00:14:20.220 Sarah and we're going to see they gotta
00:14:23.579 be something
00:14:24.899 that he has a big welcome Labyrinth I
00:14:27.720 think I've seen more Labyrinth cards
00:14:29.399 flipped face up the entire game I think
00:14:31.620 that's all I've seen the Trap tricks or
00:14:32.820 not the Trap tricks that's all I've seen
00:14:34.399 the uh Labyrinth player flip I've maybe
00:14:37.260 I've seen punishment twice and one skill
00:14:39.540 drain but it's always been big welcome
00:14:41.220 Labyrinth or welcome Labyrinth
00:14:43.980 I guess like if that's I mean that's
00:14:45.360 that's a Chase card if I remember
00:14:46.440 correctly for the like Photon hypernova
00:14:48.540 if I remember right the big welcome
00:14:49.620 Labyrinth but oh my gosh the thing I
00:14:52.260 just said a normal trap I totally forgot
00:14:53.940 that it can just set a normal trap the
00:14:55.800 knighted mama just sets a normal trap
00:14:57.240 which he gets in punishment so again
00:14:58.380 there you go
00:15:00.240 uh and that card is going to how does
00:15:04.260 that car get added back to the hand
00:15:07.500 interesting marshmallow there's gonna
00:15:09.480 attempt to pop compose he's gonna chain
00:15:10.980 compulse
00:15:13.260 but I think that
00:15:17.660 he can't because he can't talk I'll
00:15:20.459 guess he can Target the the Trap monster
00:15:22.500 right
00:15:23.880 I guess so yeah that must be it and then
00:15:26.220 that's that's a big old thick Mama there
00:15:27.779 she's going to get to destroy a card in
00:15:29.399 hand-drawn field but she can't go for
00:15:30.779 the feel sure she goes for the hand
00:15:33.000 and we're going to see a lot more
00:15:34.380 triggers man I don't know if I was able
00:15:37.019 to keep that up correctly but you know
00:15:39.120 what
00:15:40.019 it is what it is we're going to see
00:15:41.639 gravediggers get set which is actually
00:15:43.860 kind of nice I mean that's a burn for
00:15:46.019 2000 talk about like a good day like a
00:15:47.880 good card for time right and you get
00:15:49.800 call timing around you grave diggers
00:15:51.180 them or something like that but that
00:15:52.260 trap is going to activate again being
00:15:53.579 able to activate itself and discard to
00:15:55.440 actually turn it was set it could go
00:15:56.639 into a link three I honestly do not know
00:15:59.160 what this link 3 does except for it
00:16:00.360 gives everything I think a thousand
00:16:01.620 attack
00:16:02.339 which is quite decent I mean like most
00:16:06.060 these guys have really low attackers so
00:16:08.100 like a thousand boost is pretty deep
00:16:09.360 it's pretty good but like I think I
00:16:10.680 don't think they did I play anything
00:16:11.820 that locks them into it so link three
00:16:13.079 could just be like a stepstone up to
00:16:14.519 like an access code or Burl sword maybe
00:16:16.079 now borso takes three monsters but like
00:16:19.560 access code
00:16:20.880 uh two at least pop one maybe
00:16:23.699 a lot of prosperity here so he's gonna
00:16:25.199 half the damage
00:16:28.019 of the you know outgoing
00:16:30.480 but that's okay because right now
00:16:31.980 they're just trying to get into he just
00:16:34.019 managed three to go ahead and grab
00:16:35.160 strikes so this is this is not too bad
00:16:36.899 honestly this is not too shabby at all I
00:16:39.839 think so he's going to go ahead and
00:16:42.120 I don't understand what gets rid of the
00:16:44.399 big mama oh that card yes that card lets
00:16:46.680 you attach
00:16:48.360 a monster or something to it
00:16:50.399 and then yeah so we the only thing we
00:16:53.880 remember because I remember Pepperidge
00:16:55.680 Farm also remembers that the Labyrinth
00:16:58.560 player has a evenly assuming still in
00:17:00.839 his hand so
00:17:02.519 this is gonna be funny I think if the
00:17:04.859 Trap tricks player plays in that evenly
00:17:06.419 the game could swing because right now
00:17:07.619 it seems like the traffic player has
00:17:08.760 like the entire he's in the driver's
00:17:10.679 seat right now he has the advantage he
00:17:12.419 has the effects uh right now it doesn't
00:17:14.699 seem like the the Labyrinth player
00:17:16.740 really has much of anything I shouldn't
00:17:18.780 say that because he was able to set the
00:17:20.400 so he's going to activate compuls
00:17:22.740 bouncing back his own monster
00:17:24.980 interesting
00:17:26.760 that's actually pretty good
00:17:28.860 uh he's gonna draw for turn
00:17:31.919 and uh he knows that there's a
00:17:34.160 gravediggers and I don't know if he
00:17:35.760 knows the same card set we know that he
00:17:37.500 has a punishment set so I think this is
00:17:39.419 where he just tries does he fire off
00:17:41.039 punishment here can he fire off pressure
00:17:42.960 I thought reflection protected all them
00:17:45.000 from
00:17:48.059 but yeah yeah never mind we're playing
00:17:49.620 under that we're playing under the
00:17:50.940 thought that you can still attempt to
00:17:52.380 use punishment even though they're
00:17:53.580 unaffected
00:17:55.919 so again that's incorrect this entire
00:17:58.020 gameplay can be changed but it is what
00:17:59.340 it is we're gonna hit him with a
00:18:00.600 gravediggers anyways that's going to
00:18:01.620 burn them for 2 000 more so he's taking
00:18:03.539 4 000 just by gravediggers alone and I
00:18:06.360 believe we're going to see a quick end
00:18:07.919 of battle phase movement here uh a
00:18:10.080 Smackdown of that evenly that the
00:18:11.760 Labyrinth player added turn one off of
00:18:14.160 his pot of prosperity
00:18:15.720 which that could definitely swing
00:18:17.460 momentum right back into the Labyrinth
00:18:18.960 play yep there it is the good
00:18:20.880 old-fashioned evenly matched saying
00:18:22.559 banish everything but one
00:18:24.240 so I believe everything's gonna go
00:18:25.799 except for Sarah and always going to
00:18:27.240 keep reflation interesting
00:18:29.700 I mean I guess I see it why wouldn't you
00:18:31.620 keep Sarah then Sarah a trigger on a
00:18:33.360 separate chain right
00:18:37.020 I'm right right like Sarah would be able
00:18:38.460 to summon from the deck he's going to be
00:18:40.260 able to ban it to set a
00:18:43.080 big welcome Labyrinth
00:18:45.360 I mean that's
00:18:47.460 here we go momentum just kind of Trapped
00:18:49.320 this trap deck's able to uh kind of like
00:18:52.020 kind of pick up some speed I guess I
00:18:54.120 like I said I I'm not too familiar with
00:18:55.620 the purple cars dude I just I'm just
00:18:57.360 here commentating because I feel like
00:18:58.559 this would be almost watching paint dry
00:18:59.820 and I actually the real reason I'm
00:19:01.260 commentating is we had music playing I
00:19:02.640 didn't want to get copyright strike so I
00:19:04.500 figured you guys could listen to my
00:19:05.880 voice and just me kind of just rambling
00:19:07.500 on here about what I do not know these
00:19:09.000 purple cards do and it'll be a good time
00:19:11.340 and you know get some interesting
00:19:12.660 commentary so more mellow is going to
00:19:14.400 come out
00:19:15.419 by banishing I believe that trap hole
00:19:17.220 card which lets him social summon a one
00:19:18.960 from grave but Marvel's mandatory
00:19:20.940 trigger going to pop the hey welcome or
00:19:22.620 the big welcome that was just set since
00:19:24.120 a normal trap was activated this turn of
00:19:26.700 the knighted mama is going to be able to
00:19:28.440 come down we're going to see a chain of
00:19:30.600 the reflegia to the night of mama uh to
00:19:33.840 send the so to send The Floodgate trap
00:19:36.960 hole so it'll just flip it face down
00:19:38.820 when it summons itself
00:19:42.240 and uh
00:19:44.820 so we see it summon
00:19:46.860 the trap hole activates
00:19:49.260 I believe you can chain the
00:19:52.620 he can chain
00:19:55.940 the Trap card
00:19:58.320 in his hand or you can chain the trap in
00:20:01.380 the grave right I believe and this is
00:20:03.179 actually something I totally forgot
00:20:04.320 we're kind of we're discussing it here I
00:20:06.360 should have cut this out but it's too
00:20:07.440 late because I'm already doing the
00:20:08.280 commentary
00:20:09.240 uh so
00:20:11.160 we there was a question if he could
00:20:12.600 chain the big welcome Labyrinth could it
00:20:14.400 trigger the like so it'd be
00:20:16.559 summon effect reflasia on the summon
00:20:19.919 descend Floodgate chain big welcome uh
00:20:22.919 then chain the knighted Mama to it but
00:20:26.100 it doesn't work that way because that's
00:20:28.200 not an activating effect that's not
00:20:30.360 activating trap card it's a trap effect
00:20:31.679 engrave so it would not get the ability
00:20:33.660 to set a card which is okay uh I think
00:20:36.299 we play it correctly here
00:20:38.820 and see like all these rules pop up man
00:20:40.559 and like I'm I've been out of the loop
00:20:42.179 for at least like a solid two months or
00:20:43.740 something like that so my man Jason here
00:20:45.539 is gonna pop on and check it out here to
00:20:47.760 confirm that
00:20:49.500 if it can you know it can change to its
00:20:51.480 own effect
00:20:52.620 uh so I believe we just continue can you
00:20:55.260 on
00:20:56.400 I think you know what actually one
00:20:58.440 second guys okay so we went ahead and
00:21:00.900 played it like this so in response to
00:21:03.000 the uh rafflegia attempting to book the
00:21:06.240 knighted mama here it's working he's
00:21:07.860 going to chain the welcome Labyrinth we
00:21:09.000 bounce back the night at Mama I come to
00:21:11.220 find out we were correct you know you
00:21:12.660 cannot uh get a set of card because of
00:21:16.080 it's enough trap effect not trap
00:21:17.460 activating so yeah so and so yeah there
00:21:19.860 we go we're gonna see I'm set one and
00:21:22.740 there comes Sarah again my goodness then
00:21:25.020 the Trap tricks feel spill trap trick
00:21:26.640 Garden I believe is what it is right not
00:21:28.320 trap tricks but trap trick gives them an
00:21:30.240 additional normal summon and protection
00:21:31.620 from Battle which is really interesting
00:21:33.480 which is pretty decent I'd say then
00:21:35.520 we're gonna get the that's diet that's
00:21:37.260 mantis no it's Diana I forget what it is
00:21:39.480 but we're gonna get to set another
00:21:41.039 gravediggers which is actually kind of
00:21:42.780 insane that gravediggers can like he's I
00:21:44.940 think he's gravediggers like two times
00:21:46.260 so like maybe like if he gravediggers
00:21:48.120 technically two more times it's game
00:21:49.919 over which is kind of interesting which
00:21:52.080 like I don't think it'll happen in fact
00:21:54.539 I know it doesn't happen but like just
00:21:55.919 kind of think about that like the
00:21:57.059 traffic can just keep using the dang
00:21:59.520 gravediggers over and over and over it
00:22:01.559 just possibly means they can just burn
00:22:02.880 the entire game away because all it
00:22:04.740 takes is four four of them
00:22:07.020 But Here Comes the mermelo being able to
00:22:09.360 pop at the goes in we're gonna get to
00:22:11.100 see I have no clue what that card is but
00:22:13.620 it must be a normal trap or a trap hole
00:22:16.020 and he's going to set it actually I know
00:22:17.460 what it is I don't know what it lets you
00:22:18.960 destroy it and destroy a card or
00:22:20.400 something like that and we look at him
00:22:22.140 looking at the link to the first time
00:22:23.880 the link two we'll have we'll get this
00:22:26.400 link to in this match uh if we actually
00:22:27.900 got to see the link three that's kind of
00:22:29.400 cool I know this trap tricks is this
00:22:31.380 link to is kind of older it's not brand
00:22:33.240 new I don't even actually know what it
00:22:35.159 does to be honest with you I I don't
00:22:37.500 even all I know is what Sarah does I
00:22:39.299 mean cut me some slack I think that's
00:22:40.620 just how it is right
00:22:42.419 but anyway I think that's you know where
00:22:45.360 momentum swung right back into the
00:22:48.419 trap tricks player's hand like maybe
00:22:49.919 this is maybe this is why trap tricks is
00:22:51.360 really good because it's like recovery
00:22:52.620 is pretty good he's going to go quick
00:22:54.240 effect be able to summon out that thing
00:22:55.799 to protect his back row from being
00:22:57.360 destroyed so it kind of solidifies the
00:22:59.760 back row too but
00:23:01.140 Dane uh I don't know what the lavender
00:23:03.120 player can actually do what can Jason do
00:23:04.559 check in the graveyard I don't think
00:23:05.820 there's much of anything actually but if
