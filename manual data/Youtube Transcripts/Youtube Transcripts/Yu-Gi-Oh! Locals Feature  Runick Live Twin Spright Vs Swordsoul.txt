00:16:00.070 [Music]
00:16:05.760 that's true all right it was a card
00:16:20.760 [Music]
00:16:25.459 it was a very interesting opening hand
00:16:28.220 the fact that I was able to play through
00:16:30.240 that I was like very impressed myself
00:16:59.880 you're just trying to deck me out at
00:17:01.259 this point I have to come to that
00:17:03.600 honestly
00:17:05.220 um
00:17:05.839 actually thinking what effect of losing
00:17:13.199 yeah
00:17:28.400 this is the slow burning cars the games
00:17:31.260 everyone's talking about yeah
00:17:34.760 it's nothing you can do no battle phase
00:17:37.200 slows down a lot how do I keep one oh
00:17:39.419 yeah that's fine
00:18:05.720 thank you
00:18:08.760 Jesus Christ
00:18:20.240 attempt enter battle
00:18:23.480 uh one thousand over
00:18:25.799 first
00:18:36.539 and on that one oh what did I took last
00:18:38.220 time you took uh you're at 18 18 so far
00:18:41.220 so
00:18:43.020 um
00:18:50.059 to summon
00:18:52.140 yeah

00:19:09.059 with this one or loser attack so 28 over
00:19:12.360 and then 1200 Direct effects uh gonna
00:19:15.539 pop
00:19:18.440 probably Grandmaster to destroy correct
00:19:22.860 yes
00:19:25.760 thinking yeah
00:19:29.940 um
00:19:37.500 and I'll figure it out I got 12. so that
00:19:40.200 4K should be main phase two

00:20:03.260 that first piece of kill is very
00:20:05.460 important

00:45:10.619 no because you resolved like At first
00:45:13.140 yeah yeah I resolved it while you I I
00:45:17.220 assumed what was it was the last card
00:45:18.599 you have one more cargo was left
00:45:21.020 I was just assuming because I
00:45:23.400 I was like I know the rules like you
00:45:25.260 can't protect if it's already been
00:45:26.700 targeted for destruction or some weird
00:45:28.440 uh what was the thing that you had
00:45:30.660 changed like activate chain blackout
00:45:32.400 blackout where it kills it so by the
00:45:34.140 time I sung the uh
00:45:36.380 who think it's on the field I can pop
00:45:38.220 pug and who can't protect if uh you know
00:45:40.560 because the
00:45:42.500 blue is non-targeting so that's why I
00:45:44.819 like
