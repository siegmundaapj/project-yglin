00:00:04.080 yo welcome back to another video guys
00:00:06.759 I've been a little light on the uploads
00:00:08.639 lately
00:00:10.040 because I missed locals I had to work so
00:00:14.320 didn't have too much to upload but I got
00:00:16.440 another one coming up this Wednesday so
00:00:18.400 we're going to get some more videos out
00:00:20.480 there uh right off the bat you see the
00:00:22.600 player on the right he's going to open
00:00:24.000 up with saira there's a pretty hard
00:00:25.800 glare right there but I through the
00:00:28.119 actions that he's doing you can pretty
00:00:29.640 much what he's what he's activating so
00:00:31.679 super dump field spell not field spell
00:00:33.719 ritual spell um at this Ravis normal
00:00:37.000 summon low Place barrier and then uh
00:00:40.079 Safir effects tribute low summon skull
00:00:43.000 Guardian uh chain link one skull
00:00:45.160 Guardian chain link 2 low so Low's going
00:00:48.320 to get special to the field and skull
00:00:49.600 guardian's going to search another
00:00:51.960 surus uh typically people only play two
00:00:54.640 so I know two of the cards in his hand
00:00:57.359 right now I'm just asking if he already
00:00:59.559 searched with low um and what he
00:01:02.920 searched
00:01:05.600 so thinking about his next plays right
00:01:08.080 here typically what you want to see is
00:01:10.200 as the voiceless voice player you want
00:01:11.640 to get the full setup I mean School
00:01:13.360 Guardian low barrier and
00:01:16.720 uh barrier and the trap so he's going to
00:01:19.880 Ritual summon usus pitching the other
00:01:24.560 one going into a dino
00:01:28.920 Mund and then passing the turn over you
00:01:31.960 can see I draw a nib for turn pretty
00:01:34.159 unfortunate but you know as it
00:01:38.560 goes draw phase is going to dyam Mundo
00:01:41.000 effect tribute itself some the skull
00:01:42.439 guardian and then low is going to
00:01:44.759 trigger to activate trigger to
00:01:48.650 [Music]
00:01:51.280 summon so summon activates effect place
00:01:54.479 the Trap I tried to imperm it but
00:01:56.360 barrier you can't Target light monsters
00:01:58.280 for effects the card's really really
00:02:00.479 annoying but you know pretty solid so
00:02:04.119 it's going to place the
00:02:06.719 Trap I'm going to go into the go into
00:02:09.399 main phase activate the purely field
00:02:11.520 spell so this is going to really help
00:02:13.599 with getting around that uh getting
00:02:15.720 around the
00:02:17.959 Trap cuz any purely monster that special
00:02:20.640 summon can't be targeted by card
00:02:26.440 effects activate pretty memory both gain
00:02:30.800 I'm probably going to pitch the nib here
00:02:32.280 cuz it's just it's not going to do
00:02:33.519 anything even on turn even on his second
00:02:35.800 turn it's not going to do anything so
00:02:38.000 really just want to get that out of the
00:02:40.440 get that out of the
00:02:43.640 hand both gain a th and I'm going to
00:02:46.560 special
00:02:58.480 summon this is this tournament is it's
00:03:01.840 one of the first tournaments that I
00:03:03.680 played with purely uh this is actually
00:03:06.239 round it's either round two or three my
00:03:09.360 first round was absolutely horrendous um
00:03:13.200 so I still won it but it was definitely
00:03:17.200 definitely not the best so I'm probably
00:03:20.720 not going to Showcase that that match at
00:03:22.879 all um I have it you know maybe maybe if
00:03:26.519 I really want to upload it then I will
00:03:28.760 but
00:03:31.000 so I'm special summoning for Lily here
00:03:34.120 uh activating the effect he's going to
00:03:35.400 Ash boss it uh honestly I think the
00:03:38.080 better play probably would have just
00:03:39.640 been to activate skull Guardian
00:03:42.000 effect to negate it because I mean
00:03:44.840 realistically he's going to negate the
00:03:47.599 the effect of rank up
00:03:51.360 anyways so activating the effect of rank
00:03:53.879 up targeting the pretty pretty memory
00:03:57.680 engrave now if you would have just
00:03:59.439 negated did this with skull guarding
00:04:00.720 destroyed it then he wouldn't have had
00:04:02.840 to burn his Ash
00:04:08.200 Blossom activating sleepy memory
00:04:10.400 pitching the
00:04:13.400 imperm summoning the regular
00:04:18.759 pearly then activating the
00:04:24.199 effects finding a delicious off the top
00:04:26.800 which is pretty I mean that's a it's a
00:04:28.919 really good really good top deck uh
00:04:32.080 activating the I believe I'm going to
00:04:33.639 activate the effect of Lily so I have a
00:04:35.800 happy and a delicious in hand um
00:04:42.320 and it's going to go
00:04:45.400 through surus or surus isn't going to be
00:04:48.479 able to stop or negate the summon of
00:04:50.919 that
00:04:58.639 XYZ
00:05:17.840 so summoning a
00:05:21.479 plump and right here I realize I
00:05:23.680 probably should have summoned that into
00:05:24.720 attack because I'm going to attach the
00:05:27.000 two purely cards uh from Gra to my
00:05:30.120 monster and I'm going
00:05:32.520 to I'm going to take the
00:05:36.199 barrier I'm going to Tribute a card so
00:05:39.120 I'm going to set and tribute a card to
00:05:42.000 take the barrier and that's where I
00:05:44.199 realized I could have
00:05:46.120 just I could have put him in an attack
00:05:48.199 and then attacked a
00:05:49.440 low and then went into a Zeus uh but you
00:05:53.560 know now that I'm thinking of it surus
00:05:55.280 would have stopped the Ze anyway so uh I
00:05:58.039 definitely I should just scoop it up
00:05:59.400 here honestly go to a game two because
00:06:01.360 this is it you know at this point it's
00:06:04.720 pretty much
00:06:06.280 unwinable so I actually it looks like I
00:06:09.520 tributed to take the Trap which I don't
00:06:12.280 know why I was trying to play around the
00:06:13.520 Trap there was no point because you know
00:06:16.440 none of my monsters can be targeted so
00:06:19.599 I'm just going to scoop it up realizing
00:06:21.360 my misplay we're going to head right
00:06:22.479 into a game number
00:06:28.560 two hands are drawn and I'm going to
00:06:31.440 start off with the Sleepy memory I
00:06:33.919 imagine I'm doing this in the draw phase
00:06:35.560 to play around droll
00:06:37.440 failer does not play around imperm
00:06:39.720 though so Billy's going to get infermed
00:06:43.280 and I'm going to go into main phase
00:06:44.840 noral summon the
00:06:46.840 cly going to ask him to cut the top
00:06:50.039 three so finding a my friend off the top
00:06:52.560 which is a insane top
00:06:54.479 deck then I'm going to activate it P
00:06:58.520 five you can see I have a summon limit
00:07:00.680 in my hand uh I'm not super familiar
00:07:04.440 with the voiceless strategy and I
00:07:07.199 honestly didn't have too many things to
00:07:09.199 side into uh someon them it's a terrible
00:07:12.680 choice but I didn't know that so I threw
00:07:16.440 those in there I can't remember exactly
00:07:18.639 what I took out I know I took out nibs
00:07:21.479 and well you see one nib in because I
00:07:24.560 think I'm playing cross out so I kept
00:07:26.680 one in for the cross outs
00:07:32.639 CU I didn't want him to nib me now that
00:07:34.800 I have a little bit more so th this
00:07:36.759 match was like a week ago and I've
00:07:38.039 gotten a lot more experience with Dr
00:07:39.639 since then honestly I don't think the
00:07:41.520 deck really cares if you get nibbed so I
00:07:44.720 I'm also going to take the cross outs
00:07:46.400 out of the deck uh cuz that card is it
00:07:49.440 just doesn't do enough like the only
00:07:52.360 thing that really hurts is droll
00:07:54.199 anything other than that I I think the
00:07:56.280 deck can play through
00:07:58.440 honestly
00:08:01.319 so activating the purely effect going
00:08:04.240 into the little Noir then activating
00:08:06.560 pretty memory and chaining the
00:08:10.759 Noir so setting the
00:08:13.850 [Music]
00:08:16.840 Trap then going into a link Freo and
00:08:20.199 setting my summon
00:08:24.479 limit but during the standby phase I'm
00:08:26.639 going to activate the nor effect to draw
00:08:29.479 and then ranking it up into the big Noir
00:08:32.799 and then drawing
00:08:40.760 again goes standby main goes into battle
00:08:44.920 activates the evenly he going to banish
00:08:47.480 or I'm going to banish everything but
00:08:48.800 the big Noir uh really sucks but you
00:08:53.000 know not a whole lot you can really do
00:08:54.839 about
00:08:56.360 that so it's not like losing the kuo and
00:09:00.079 summon them it was really a big deal but
00:09:03.959 overall pretty
00:09:05.480 annoying losing to my friend was
00:09:07.600 honestly the worst uh and then right
00:09:10.000 here I
00:09:12.560 mean he activates he starts with pre-
00:09:15.240 prep I go Ash he goes call by there's
00:09:17.720 there's literally nothing you can do
00:09:19.120 there uh I was reading Noir and I read
00:09:21.800 call by
00:09:24.240 because I didn't know if I could shuffle
00:09:26.320 my ash back and Dodge The Call by
00:09:29.880 if I could that would have been a sick
00:09:31.800 play but Noir only shuffles your
00:09:34.399 opponent's cards so he adds a surus and
00:09:38.000 adds the uh ritual spell and then
00:09:40.640 pitches the safira so I mean his hand's
00:09:43.320 absolutely insane right
00:09:45.200 now don't imagine he's really going to
00:09:47.279 lose this
00:09:48.620 [Music]
00:09:58.320 one
00:10:07.000 right here I'm just considering the
00:10:08.640 option of shuffling back
00:10:10.360 toir uh and I know I think I know three
00:10:13.200 of the cards in his hand I know the
00:10:14.959 ritual spell surus and skull
00:10:19.399 Guardian so he's got one unknown I
00:10:22.600 honestly I probably should
00:10:25.360 have shuffled back to safira so then he
00:10:28.200 would have had a ritual spell
00:10:30.600 and use the surus and skull guard in
00:10:33.399 from his hand leaving him one card in
00:10:36.600 hand but it's just it's one of those
00:10:39.480 things where you know I only know
00:10:42.440 looking back on it so I'm going to
00:10:44.040 activate nor effect Shuffle back the low
00:10:46.279 but he's just going to add it with the
00:10:47.519 skull
00:10:48.320 guardian and then normal
00:10:54.160 summon right here I'm just I'm really in
00:10:56.560 a losing position I have one card in
00:10:58.200 hand I have a top deck uh nothing
00:11:00.680 engrave that really activates so uh
00:11:03.880 definitely in in a really really bad
00:11:05.920 position here and I can't really Target
00:11:08.680 anything on his field cuz he has a surus
00:11:10.720 in
00:11:18.200 hand so for special summon low for
00:11:21.320 normal summon low and then placing the
00:11:24.000 barrier barrier effect is going to get
00:11:26.200 him the search from the deck it's going
00:11:28.480 to get the Trap
00:11:33.560 and I mean from right here he's he's
00:11:35.279 pretty set up there's not a whole lot
00:11:37.079 left that he needs I mean he can go for
00:11:39.480 surus uh the regular surus not the
00:11:43.079 ritual
00:11:45.040 but you know even even then I don't
00:11:47.440 think he really needs
00:11:53.880 that draw pH he's just going to flip it
00:11:56.399 face
00:11:58.240 up
00:12:04.240 and I'm considering if there's there's
00:12:06.120 any way to win from
00:12:08.120 here but I really really don't think
00:12:11.079 there
00:12:12.360 is I think the only way would have been
00:12:14.800 to draw my
00:12:28.160 friend
00:12:30.650 [Music]
00:12:49.160 activating Noir uh attempting to put
00:12:51.600 back one of his either the continuous
00:12:53.680 well or continuous trap I'm not sure
00:12:55.160 which one I targeted but he's going to
00:12:57.519 negate it with the school Guardian going
00:12:59.000 to normal summon the Lily activate the
00:13:00.880 effect to
00:13:02.000 search he's going to let that go
00:13:05.040 through the only thing I can imagine
00:13:07.079 myself getting here is a is my friend
00:13:19.720 KY cuz the field spell and the trap
00:13:22.360 aren't going to do anything I just used
00:13:23.839 my normal summon so adding a regular
00:13:26.360 curly isn't going to do anything
00:13:31.600 now all he has left really as far as I
00:13:34.160 know for Interruption is
00:13:37.160 the uh is the Trap effect to pop if that
00:13:40.720 last card in my hand were a were a happy
00:13:44.199 memory instead of I think it's a pretty
00:13:46.600 I think it's pretty memory if it were
00:13:48.440 happy instead that would be absolutely
00:13:50.759 insane but unfortunately it's not if it
00:13:53.759 were a happy memory I could activate the
00:13:55.360 happy or I could activate the my friend
00:13:57.720 and then if he activates the effect of
00:13:59.920 I
00:14:01.519 could um I could just protect it with
00:14:05.040 happy but it's not going to
00:14:13.240 happen so I'm going to rank up into a
00:14:16.800 beauty uh I'm right here what I was just
00:14:19.519 hoping is that he would negate theil
00:14:23.959 effect so then I could have just
00:14:25.800 activated the H or the my friend but
00:14:29.240 just it's not going to happen so I'm
00:14:30.959 gonna activate the
00:14:34.800 beauty or activate the pretty memory
00:14:37.079 chain Beauty to
00:14:39.050 [Music]
00:14:51.880 attach and then change the battle
00:14:54.160 position of the school Guardian attack
00:14:55.959 into it I'm going to go into a Zeus here
00:15:06.440 but it's just the the Zeus really isn't
00:15:08.560 going to do a whole lot cuz he has
00:15:11.120 the uh he has the ritual spell engrave
00:15:14.199 so if I clear his board then he gets to
00:15:16.240 summon a ritual from grave and he gets
00:15:18.160 to summon the low back so then he he
00:15:20.519 literally all I do is really just get
00:15:22.240 rid of the barrier which doesn't matter
00:15:24.759 at all and then since the Zeus only has
00:15:26.680 four materials he can let that one go
00:15:28.800 through through and then just negate the
00:15:30.319 next one like I I'm in I'm pretty much
00:15:33.600 checkmated right here there's no way I
00:15:35.560 can win I have no cards in hand nothing
00:15:41.759 engrave so he's going to add a spar from
00:15:44.319 or from deck to hand I'm assuming that
00:15:45.880 was with the barrier
00:15:47.920 effect I think he's just thinking of
00:15:50.160 what what he can do here to finish me
00:15:52.839 off so it switches it to
00:15:57.920 attack
00:16:00.880 and then battle phase I'm going to
00:16:02.720 activate Zeus he's going to negate I
00:16:04.600 chain the Zeus effect uh the zoo should
00:16:07.560 be gone cuz the first uh activation was
00:16:11.079 negated and should be
00:16:13.680 destroyed but you know either
00:16:17.920 way I'm going to activate the uh my
00:16:22.240 purely Le engrave shuffling back uh some
00:16:25.720 monsters giving me a better top deck but
00:16:28.480 you know this this is this game is
00:16:30.240 pretty much over
00:16:32.480 here so seeing that now I'm going to
00:16:34.680 scoop it up uh that's that's going to be
00:16:36.639 all for this game appreciate you guys
00:16:38.399 for sticking to the end and I will catch
00:16:40.040 you guys in the next one
00:16:42.519 peace
