00:30:09.440 yep start the damage okay so I will go
00:30:13.559 CH attacks damage start of damage effect
00:30:16.039 summons one from De right yep okay
00:30:18.640 cool I'll summon the green one I take no
00:30:20.880 batt damage because green on the field
00:30:22.240 he can't
00:30:26.960 yep how does that work like not that
00:30:29.080 part but like this attacks this is on
00:30:30.919 feel you but doesn't it it cause a
00:30:32.840 replay to happen so so like this how the
00:30:35.519 damage set works I declare an attack
00:30:37.240 that's on attack declaration uh if you
00:30:39.480 have nothing on attack deck it goes to
00:30:40.960 the damage step start of the damage step
00:30:42.760 before damage calculation is applied and
00:30:44.440 monsters are destroyed that would be
00:30:45.720 summon right effect of this would summon
00:30:47.200 this immediately at the start of the
00:30:48.200 damage step okay so no replay then we
00:30:49.880 then we no replay occurs and then um and
00:30:52.559 then during damage calculation we apply
00:30:54.559 the damage that I would take uh and then
00:30:56.720 the monsters deter to Destro not the
00:30:58.639 monster is determined to be destroyed
00:30:59.799 but fyra says that your fire monsters
00:31:01.480 cannot beestro by battle and then fyra
00:31:02.840 says I don't take right no no that part
00:31:04.559 I knew I to know about the replay part
00:31:06.360 okay no
00:31:07.480 worries cool cool I got it and and you

01:45:04.119 GG
01:45:06.480 G all right guys here's the goo you guys
01:45:09.320 ready wi four one today lost you bells
01:45:11.719 that is broken anyways three chundra The
01:45:14.360 Big
01:45:15.320 chunga Three pyra obviously yep thank
01:45:19.520 you I'll I'm I'm coming thank two fyra
01:45:23.040 this is like standard right eight of the
01:45:25.360 Dragons uh one magn this card is if you
01:45:27.679 draw this card you're the
01:45:29.480 goat uh three sing summoning three
01:45:32.080 comment thank
01:45:33.280 you and then one terraforming so you see
01:45:35.599 it more
01:45:36.560 often three
01:45:39.480 Prosperity um oh the thing is uh
01:45:43.440 summoning is crazy because you can only
01:45:45.679 use the effect once per turn but uh
01:45:47.679 drawing multiples is nice because you
01:45:49.040 can bait them out and activate it again
01:45:50.840 just to put it on the field to make all
01:45:52.199 your fire dragons
01:45:54.080 uh not affected um two storm duster just
01:45:57.800 because like when you make Dex schull
01:45:59.599 first having storm and back R is like
01:46:01.679 really clean maybe going forward these
01:46:03.599 should be cosmics and sets cuz they work
01:46:05.199 first and second but these cards are
01:46:07.599 like really good because like when you
01:46:08.719 make people start their back R is like
01:46:10.159 really crazy um three as Bome three
01:46:13.080 imperm three shifter I didn't want to
01:46:14.960 play too many hand traps I just wanted
01:46:16.199 to play like the best one and I thought
01:46:18.000 these are like the most generically just
01:46:19.480 good coverage and everything so
01:46:24.560 uh then I play like cash engine because
01:46:26.679 I feel like the deck's really good at
01:46:27.840 going second but you want some stuff to
01:46:29.199 help you when you go first um and so
01:46:31.199 like yeah two frener two unicorn uh two
01:46:34.840 RS um and then one set rotation CU it
01:46:37.880 works really well with your uh F spell
01:46:40.840 for tenpai and then one theosis one
01:46:43.040 birth typically people only play birth
01:46:44.840 but I play theosis because um uh
01:46:48.400 basically when you go first you can go
01:46:50.599 especially in unicorn unicorn get
01:46:52.239 theosis noral pyra Hydra get S um the
01:46:55.840 quick play search chundra special Tundra
01:46:57.760 Mi seal then you can activate theosis on
01:47:00.440 um on the Unicorn some fener so you add
01:47:05.080 on like seals fener unicorn um which is
01:47:08.000 like pretty decent it's like a pretty
01:47:09.239 decent board I'm going first so yeah 40
01:47:12.800 cards and then my side is one call by
01:47:16.080 one fer one unicorn just to help me when
01:47:18.360 I go
01:47:19.520 first uh then I play three nib three
01:47:22.480 veiler
01:47:23.400 three ogre three pro pro because it
01:47:27.159 covers pearly um and it covers like the
01:47:29.239 mirror match way
01:47:30.800 better um so that's why I really like
01:47:33.560 this
01:47:35.840 card um oh the other PR helps you
01:47:39.280 against the ply match up too and yeah in
01:47:41.239 the mirror is really good because you
01:47:42.199 can hit their 607 or you can hit the
01:47:43.800 target off of uh the green so this car
01:47:46.000 is like really really good I like it
01:47:47.520 more than
01:47:48.560 BS um yeah ogre to cover the mirror
01:47:51.480 match to beat PE to beat ell like OG on
01:47:55.199 juell is like really good CU you can hit
01:47:57.000 their nightmare pain stuff I decided to
01:47:59.119 play veiler nib and more hand traps and
01:48:01.440 I don't slide like floodgates for going
01:48:02.760 first because I feel like if people make
01:48:05.440 you
01:48:06.159 start uh if people make you start uh you
01:48:09.560 can use like hand traps like are always
01:48:11.960 good so start going first with like ktic
01:48:14.280 steal and like these hand traps are like
01:48:15.679 I think good enough to survive so that's
01:48:17.599 why I think these are like really
01:48:19.639 solid um and then yeah just one one on
01:48:21.960 one just like make it more consistent
01:48:23.560 for going first these could these could
01:48:25.360 also be like three more floodgates but I
01:48:27.000 think like you don't really it's weird I
01:48:29.639 know people are all sighting floods but
01:48:30.840 I don't really think you need them like
01:48:31.920 that um I think like you're going first
01:48:33.840 board is like good enough every time for
01:48:35.840 the extra deck I play two belt Black
01:48:39.080 Rose uh two
01:48:41.920 Biden uh two of the Transcendent one
