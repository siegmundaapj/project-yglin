00:00:01.880 channel down in the description hey what
00:00:04.040 is up guys is meam GX here and we are
00:00:07.359 going to be going over basically um all
00:00:11.320 the tech options that you can be running
00:00:13.280 with branded desia at the moment I think
00:00:15.480 we are going to go over main deck te
00:00:18.320 Tech options extra Deck Tech options and
00:00:20.560 then side Deck Tech options this can be
00:00:22.600 anything we're going to be starting
00:00:24.000 basic with each pile as we see we have a
00:00:26.400 lot of cards so we're going to be here
00:00:27.400 for a while we're going to be starting
00:00:28.880 basic like with qu with if we're running
00:00:31.240 gimmick puppet or not but then also
00:00:32.840 we're going to start getting to really
00:00:34.160 specific stuff like Fusion parasite and
00:00:38.160 uh goddess the third eye so if you guys
00:00:40.600 want to see more content like this make
00:00:42.039 sure to leave a like down below I think
00:00:43.719 this will be a very good kind of
00:00:46.120 informative video where we're kind of
00:00:48.239 going to do an
00:00:49.960 anthology where we're going to kind of
00:00:51.680 do an anthology of basically every
00:00:53.800 option that you can run in branded desia
00:00:56.480 in terms of tech options and just like
00:00:58.559 different play patterns and different uh
00:01:01.239 in different deck building strategies so
00:01:03.440 if you guys want to see more content
00:01:04.959 like this if you guys want to see a
00:01:06.920 board breaker T list for brand desia for
00:01:10.280 non-engine including hand traps please
00:01:12.600 make sure leave a like below get this to
00:01:14.600 100 likes and we'll make sure to do
00:01:17.479 it all right so we're going to be
00:01:20.280 talking about main Deck Tech options
00:01:21.680 we're going to be talking about quem so
00:01:23.439 a lot of people only run one quem in
00:01:25.520 branded dpia in my opinion you should be
00:01:27.920 running two quem now why why is this
00:01:30.680 because with only one Clen this
00:01:33.200 basically cuts off a lot of your combo
00:01:34.960 lines and it makes your extra deck sends
00:01:37.000 a lot worse because if you draw your one
00:01:38.880 quem then was your Titan clad sending or
00:01:41.200 special summoning out in the end phase
00:01:42.600 most of the time um also uh it makes it
00:01:46.200 so that you know you have extra combo
00:01:48.920 lines because you go through one quem on
00:01:50.399 your turn then go through another quem
00:01:51.680 on your opponent's turn in order to set
00:01:53.520 your graveyard for different combos then
00:01:55.799 also it allows you to play through
00:01:57.360 Nibiru even better because if you
00:01:59.079 already used first quim and your
00:02:01.399 opponent Gran wignalls you or sorry if
00:02:04.000 your opponent uh Nibiru is you and you
00:02:05.840 have gr wignall somewhere in the
00:02:07.039 graveyard or on the field you can
00:02:08.360 obviously go into quem even if they've
00:02:10.520 tributed over your first quem so having
00:02:13.080 the second one I think is very important
00:02:15.440 by that extension I think we can talk
00:02:17.120 about the other girl uh caresia I think
00:02:20.160 that a lot of people have traditionally
00:02:21.640 only ran to caresia but I think that
00:02:24.000 right now we should be running three
00:02:25.160 caresia as branded players I think right
00:02:27.560 now you see a lot of hand traps in the
00:02:29.400 format this could change in a format
00:02:31.000 without a lot of imperm and veilers so
00:02:32.720 if you're watching this video maybe a
00:02:34.599 year from now and things are still you
00:02:37.560 know not not too different with the deck
00:02:39.640 then um you can obviously use uh I I
00:02:43.280 that's the point of this video I'm
00:02:44.360 trying to make it so it's going to be
00:02:45.360 future prooof as well but um CIO is able
00:02:48.680 to Dodge in perm and veiler very well so
00:02:51.360 I think that's why a lot of lists are on
00:02:53.120 three copies of each uh caresia right
00:02:55.680 now also gives you a really good Grind
00:02:57.280 game because you can keep one in
00:02:58.159 graveyard one on field and one in hand
00:02:59.959 for discard fder and keep rotating
00:03:01.640 through them different turns very
00:03:03.720 important in my opinion should you be
00:03:05.360 running gimmick puppet or not yes you
00:03:06.879 should be running gimmick puet until
00:03:08.239 this gets banned if sanctifier gets
00:03:09.879 banned obviously you don't need to run
00:03:11.000 this anymore but this is your best going
00:03:12.440 first option Brandon is one of the best
00:03:14.200 decks even still without gimmick puppet
00:03:15.879 but this gives us a very uh easy uh Kill
00:03:18.760 Shot basically going first and you know
00:03:21.720 we should use it until it gets banned
00:03:23.400 sanctify is broken card even with or
00:03:25.319 without puppet so if you're running
00:03:26.879 sanctifier you should probably just be
00:03:27.959 running the puppet it's very free gives
00:03:29.480 you uh very easy game ones makes your
00:03:32.120 game ones go by faster so that your
00:03:34.280 games get over uh faster so you don't
00:03:36.879 always go into time you know as a
00:03:38.519 branded player you probably don't go
00:03:39.799 into time very
00:03:41.480 much all right so we're going to be
00:03:43.360 talking about gold Sark and foolish this
00:03:45.120 was signed by Simo shout out to the man
00:03:46.879 himself however I think that gold Stark
00:03:49.480 and foolish are one of the best cards or
00:03:51.879 some of the best extenders generically
00:03:53.560 for Branded they can also be thrust
00:03:55.159 targets because they are normal spells
00:03:57.280 however they both basically extend you
00:03:59.120 into a U into Cario in the case of
00:04:01.560 banishing Mercer off a goldark but you
00:04:03.560 know foolish sending the tragedy or
00:04:05.519 maybe even completing the combo piece by
00:04:07.480 sending a sneer shrer dragon or even a
00:04:10.159 gimmick puppet is very good so I
00:04:11.599 recommend running these largely I think
00:04:13.319 in a droll format you can kind of afford
00:04:15.280 to go cut gold star but I think foolish
00:04:17.959 is very much um very good and you should
00:04:20.000 probably run it but obviously they are
00:04:22.160 not necessary but you know these are
00:04:23.919 very good option speaking of those you
00:04:25.680 have Tri Brigade speaking of those we
00:04:28.320 have Tri Brigade mercur and Tra tredy um
00:04:30.759 in Allura Darkness so I think Allura
00:04:33.199 darkness is very good in branded dpia
00:04:35.919 unless you're in a hugely droll format
00:04:38.080 and honestly I don't think we've been in
00:04:39.520 one yet um since super heavy really to
00:04:42.280 where all Darkness isn't worth running
00:04:44.479 but I think that the deck the card is
00:04:45.960 very free for the most part you and plus
00:04:48.520 a lot of people traditionally will side
00:04:50.199 out draws against branded um so I think
00:04:53.560 that allur kind of goes free with
00:04:55.360 branded for the most part it helps you
00:04:56.759 see your engine going second it's very
00:04:58.440 good in that respect it also helps you
00:04:59.759 cycle through some of your bricks very
00:05:01.280 easily because you run a lot of uh elbaz
00:05:03.680 is a lot of uh builds are now running
00:05:06.720 three shrouded Dragon for the
00:05:09.000 consistency purpose uh because this card
00:05:11.120 is basically a you know uh plus one
00:05:14.800 because you get the r in graveyard plus
00:05:16.320 a draw so very good you get more
00:05:18.080 resources and so running three of those
00:05:20.479 it's a brick if you see the second one
00:05:22.000 well if you have a lure you can just
00:05:22.960 banish it and then also having the trag
00:05:25.560 or mer carier obviously with AER makes
00:05:27.720 it so your Aller is a plus one always
00:05:29.400 which is is very good so you can
00:05:31.039 obviously just decide if you're going to
00:05:32.360 be running two mercu or one tragedy or
00:05:34.759 two tragedy or one mercu or that is the
00:05:36.600 correct mathematical ratio for running
00:05:38.840 Aller Darkness you shouldn't be on one
00:05:40.280 in one at that point you're probably
00:05:42.319 just not should be running Aller
00:05:44.080 Darkness but if you run two in one
00:05:45.800 you're going to be able to see these
00:05:46.919 cards enough with alert Darkness to
00:05:48.520 where that uh you're going to be able to
00:05:50.199 go plus one very easily one shrouded
00:05:52.280 dragon is also has has been the standard
00:05:54.479 it's something that you can continue to
00:05:55.919 do I think it's very much just
00:05:57.479 preference base I think if you're on a
00:05:58.919 High Spirits build build or an aure
00:06:00.400 build I'll be on the sh dragons very
00:06:02.080 good so let's talk about more of those
00:06:03.840 options because aure kind of goes very
00:06:05.639 hand inand with these two cards nadir
00:06:07.440 servant and branded and High Spirit and
00:06:09.880 we'll put in Maximus for the Nadar
00:06:11.560 servant I think that right now you see a
00:06:13.880 lot of people running Brandon and High
00:06:15.840 Spirits over nadir servant but in the
00:06:17.840 past I think you've seen more people run
00:06:19.280 nadir servant actually in the past I
00:06:21.000 mean you see Master D actually putting
00:06:22.360 the card to two it's a very broken card
00:06:24.479 a lot of the time this card can result
00:06:26.440 in a one card combo for a gimmick puppet
00:06:28.440 nightmare um if you send the tri Brigade
00:06:30.800 buus you send the tri Brigade bruus
00:06:33.599 which then can send a Brig Rand which
00:06:35.440 then can one card combo if you guys want
00:06:37.400 to see that I have a combo video down
00:06:38.759 below but anyways um it goes with
00:06:41.000 Maximus basically you get to uh send
00:06:43.680 dump an extra Deck card a lot of the
00:06:45.240 time what you'll dump as Tri Brigade or
00:06:46.960 a gura then you will get to Plus off of
00:06:49.759 these and then you can banish for
00:06:50.880 Maximus and then you can use Maximus to
00:06:52.720 send a Titan clad plus an albon to
00:06:55.000 basically full card combo um very good
00:06:57.240 card in my opinion however this card
00:06:58.720 isn't great against shifter um so so for
00:07:02.280 that reason ner servant can be pretty
00:07:04.080 weak I mean I still ran it in full power
00:07:05.720 cach you know it's a very good card very
00:07:07.240 powerful but I think a lot of people
00:07:08.680 have been opting to run brand High
00:07:09.960 Spirits for that reason it is a very
00:07:12.080 good card you reveal one monster your
00:07:13.280 hand the S one level eight Fusion
00:07:14.440 Monster so basically you can reveal a
00:07:15.879 dark dragon Sunday shrouded dra or
00:07:17.560 Sunday albon the brand dragon or a
00:07:19.240 Titanic lad from your graveyard or to
00:07:20.879 your ex the graveyard and you are going
00:07:23.240 to be able to basically almost full
00:07:24.759 combo off of that it's not as much
00:07:26.160 Advantage as ner servant with Maximus
00:07:28.360 but you're also getting less carded uh
00:07:30.720 lost commitment because with nadir
00:07:32.440 servant you're probably going to have to
00:07:33.400 run Tri Brigade or you're going to have
00:07:34.560 to run gura um if you want to get the F
00:07:37.080 not I mean obviously you could just cut
00:07:38.199 the Maximus and then just only run three
00:07:40.160 Nance less commitment but at that point
00:07:41.759 you should probably be running High
00:07:42.840 Spirits because High Spirits is a bit
00:07:44.120 better of a card on its own um however
00:07:46.520 High Spirits is much more Reliant
00:07:48.919 because you need a dark dragon
00:07:50.400 essentially for this to be a very good
00:07:51.840 card if you don't see a dark dragon it's
00:07:53.960 really getting into the territory of
00:07:55.400 going NE a bit because you are going to
00:07:57.840 get your search yes but you are going to
00:07:59.199 go one and the discard and then also um
00:08:02.960 the thing you're sending in the end
00:08:04.159 phase isn't as good uh you can send gnal
00:08:07.319 which is pretty good but you usually w't
00:08:08.680 use those so it's not great in that
00:08:10.560 respect so that's why I typically prefer
00:08:11.960 nadir or lur than High Spirits but it's
00:08:14.680 definitely it's a searchable card that's
00:08:15.960 the nice part so that's why like as a
00:08:17.319 one of it's also once per turn so that's
00:08:19.599 why I still prefer Aur over this I
00:08:21.599 prefer nir over High Spirits too but I
00:08:23.759 still run like one and three usually
00:08:25.520 with my ratios but you know depending on
00:08:27.199 the format you could you know CH pick
00:08:28.919 and choose these are great ways these
00:08:30.639 are the ways that you can play through
00:08:32.440 hand traps very easily like you they go
00:08:35.159 Ash on you you you go Nader servant um
00:08:38.440 and then you basically full combo
00:08:39.719 through it and then High Spirits it's
00:08:41.240 very good because it it can't they are
00:08:43.958 never going to Ash High Spirits uh they
00:08:46.040 have to they have to Ash this for it to
00:08:47.760 go off so they can't use ash twice per
00:08:50.080 turn so they'll Ash your brand Fusion
00:08:51.920 then you can go and you'll usually go
00:08:53.480 High Spirits in the draw phase or
00:08:55.040 something uh I usually recommend to play
00:08:56.920 around shifter so wait for the shifter
00:08:58.560 kind of um unless you have to uh play
00:09:01.480 into it to extend kind of thing um nadir
00:09:04.560 servant loses to imperm a bit more
00:09:06.120 because the Maximus will get imperm so
00:09:08.560 that you can get ashermed on if you have
00:09:11.079 brand fusion um deer Ser which can can
00:09:13.640 suck this can't get ashermed but you get
00:09:16.240 more Advantage off the nadir to be fair
00:09:18.120 and this is this isn't always live nadir
00:09:20.640 is always live so also nadir can play
00:09:23.079 through rooll because you can uh get
00:09:24.800 from the graveyard so you can discard
00:09:26.399 from graveyard then go in ner and still
00:09:28.519 play the game Maximus is also kind of
00:09:30.440 neat too because you can Duality it for
00:09:32.560 droon because it's a light spell Caster
00:09:34.399 so interesting nadir does kind of suck
00:09:36.680 because it locks you though that's a
00:09:38.160 thing it locks you out the extra deck so
00:09:40.320 um these are things you have to consider
00:09:41.800 but most of the time by the time you get
00:09:43.000 locked out you're done with your your
00:09:44.600 turn the deer servant is your last play
00:09:46.959 in your combo line so it doesn't really
00:09:48.959 matter if you're locked out it does suck
00:09:50.480 when you can't go tight and clad in the
00:09:51.680 end phase for albas but that's fine you
00:09:53.519 can just do that on your opponent's turn
00:09:55.519 now what are other main deck ways to
00:09:56.920 play through hand traps but also maybe
00:09:58.680 break board
00:10:00.040 well we have the freight for patchwork
00:10:01.440 engine also I do want to recommend kit
00:10:04.040 with the High Spirits if you do run High
00:10:05.959 Spirits you definitely want to run
00:10:07.560 span's kit because kit is searchable off
00:10:09.800 of High Spirits it's basically an Al
00:10:11.320 Luber so you're going to be able to um
00:10:14.160 you know on certain hands be able to go
00:10:16.079 search uh do your combo also kit is
00:10:18.120 really nice because you can get your
00:10:19.320 banished stuff so you can recycle
00:10:21.320 retribution or branded sword stuff like
00:10:23.279 that it's also free extension so you can
00:10:25.200 otk very easily so just run K if you're
00:10:27.399 on High Spirits and if you're not on
00:10:28.839 High Spirits don't run kit kind of
00:10:30.480 that's the logic Kit's also not bad
00:10:32.040 because it's say dark if you want to
00:10:33.240 help maxing out in darks with
00:10:35.440 theer now let's talk about other ways to
00:10:38.120 extend through hand traps but also maybe
00:10:39.800 break the
00:10:40.959 board and then other ways to play
00:10:44.440 through uh bals and also just having
00:10:46.440 like a other ways to play through hand
00:10:48.200 traps and having another game plan
00:10:50.160 because D barrier is out there also is
00:10:52.079 having the best steel package actually
00:10:53.880 so you can do it you can do a huge
00:10:55.720 package with Brant regain and like more
00:10:57.600 L Bellion and then also just run brand
00:10:59.680 and white or brand High Spirits because
00:11:01.560 brand High Spirits go with bis steals
00:11:03.160 very well so if you're running a big bis
00:11:04.600 steel package you might run might as
00:11:06.440 well run three brand High Spirits and
00:11:08.160 that's kind of like the reverse if
00:11:09.360 you're running brand High Spirits might
00:11:10.600 as well run bunch of B steals so you
00:11:13.040 have the best bridge for a brand High
00:11:14.399 Spirits a dark dragon um I think in a
00:11:17.399 format with a lot D barrier and like
00:11:19.560 other things where you need to be have
00:11:21.760 the ability to play through hand traps
00:11:23.079 and put bodies on the field the bestial
00:11:25.440 allow you to do that they also help you
00:11:27.240 combo because they are dark so they can
00:11:28.680 Bridge with your uh extenders like alert
00:11:31.079 darkness and High Spirits but also they
00:11:33.160 can get you into your combo with uh
00:11:34.760 sarer which helps you Sunday brand SP
00:11:37.279 trap card to the graveyard or Lu Bellion
00:11:39.240 which helps you get into brand lost or
00:11:40.959 brand regained or even branded Beast
00:11:43.399 which allows you to then pop a card on
00:11:45.040 your opponent side of the field also
00:11:46.880 lets you set lost in the end phase which
00:11:48.800 is really good or another one so very
00:11:50.600 good brand regain lets you get just a
00:11:52.360 lot of Advantage recycle brand uh spells
00:11:54.920 and trap cards it's really good in the
00:11:56.440 Synchro version but Synchro version got
00:11:58.160 a lot worse with Baron and Savage um
00:12:01.320 band so not really going to talk too
00:12:03.240 much about the Synchro version uh Droid
00:12:05.360 storm is very good it's basically the
00:12:06.880 best one uh because if you fuse off with
00:12:09.160 it on the field with like poly or
00:12:10.399 something you will pop a card so very
00:12:11.880 good but baldr's also a very good n
00:12:13.880 board piece because you use only lights
00:12:16.279 and darks so you can tribute basically
00:12:17.720 any card on your field basically for a
00:12:19.600 solemn warning which is very good it's a
00:12:21.839 search off of magn magnum's actually one
00:12:23.600 of the best main Decko ones because you
00:12:25.160 can search any brand in your deck like
00:12:26.839 albz or shroud Dragon for followup or
00:12:29.199 the graveyard very good also I forgot to
00:12:32.120 talk about blazing uh brightest blazing
00:12:34.399 branded King this card is very good it's
00:12:36.399 one of the most obscure cards and
00:12:37.720 branded but it's also made deck uh
00:12:39.920 basically it's a onfield uh negate for
00:12:42.480 everything as long as you have a Fusion
00:12:43.760 Monster that uh mentions fallen valz and
00:12:46.199 negate the effects of all their face up
00:12:47.560 cards on the field currently Until the
00:12:49.000 End phase so basically all the face up
00:12:50.480 cards on that are that are on there when
00:12:52.600 this card is activated get negated for
00:12:54.320 the rest of the turn so it can get over
00:12:56.320 things like stun for that reason or you
00:12:58.079 can get over things like by if you chain
00:12:59.959 this to called by or droplet very good
00:13:02.199 one of your only inway engine outs for
00:13:05.000 uh getting a round droplet and called by
00:13:07.519 which is one of your biggest outs you
00:13:09.279 know a lot of people name those speaking
00:13:11.600 about board Breakers and speaking about
00:13:13.160 droplet here's droplet here's super poly
00:13:15.839 here's thrust here's Talons so I think
00:13:19.079 that these are the best board Breakers
00:13:20.880 in branded dpia for the most part so um
00:13:24.199 I think that and book of eclipse these
00:13:26.440 are the five best board Breakers in
00:13:28.079 branded dpia for for the most part
00:13:29.800 because they are all quick play except
00:13:32.000 for Talons and thrust which are able to
00:13:34.160 still be used going first because thrust
00:13:36.160 is a custom card which will get you out
00:13:37.839 to Fusion duplication which basically is
00:13:40.519 a branded Fusion on wheels that card is
00:13:43.199 broken and then we also have uh triple
00:13:45.720 tactics Talons which is a board breaker
00:13:47.600 and it allows you to draw two or rip a
00:13:49.399 card from your opponent's hand when they
00:13:50.680 Ash you which you're basically
00:13:51.880 guaranteed to get ashed as a branded
00:13:53.360 players talents is usually live so it's
00:13:55.600 very free at multiple copies in your
00:13:57.519 deck but you could also just run it at
00:13:58.839 one to search off a Thrust going second
00:14:00.639 to break a board because it's go it's
00:14:02.240 taking with out targeting effect is one
00:14:04.040 of the best board Breakers in the game
00:14:05.519 if you see Talons uh thrust in your hand
00:14:07.920 going second as a branded player you
00:14:09.320 break any board essentially so I think
00:14:11.399 that's why these cards are mandatory in
00:14:12.959 a highle branded deck uh these other
00:14:14.959 cards aren't really as mandatory but I
00:14:16.720 think that they C com and go with the
00:14:18.360 formats book of eclipse you saw a lot in
00:14:20.160 cashier format but not So Much Anymore
00:14:22.000 allows you to dodge imp perm on your
00:14:23.480 Uber because you can chain on Al Luber
00:14:25.519 and they will flip down you'll still get
00:14:26.759 the search very good it's also can get
00:14:29.360 over a board pretty easily but you know
00:14:31.880 right now we're in 2024 and there's a
00:14:33.360 lot of Link boards and also Fusion
00:14:34.839 boards so book of eclipse isn't really
00:14:36.519 that great um for that reason but you
00:14:39.120 could also s it for purely and stuff
00:14:40.720 like that or casera so definitely
00:14:42.560 something to consider even this format
00:14:44.680 super poly is something that
00:14:46.079 traditionally has been a mandatory run
00:14:48.480 in branded dpia for the most part
00:14:50.120 because all your fusions are very
00:14:51.720 generic for the most part you know they
00:14:53.720 need very generic materials um it's
00:14:56.480 they're very easy to get out for the
00:14:58.199 most part so the thing is is that you're
00:15:00.920 going to have to uh super poly was
00:15:02.959 always very free in the deck however I
00:15:04.800 think with snake eye a lot of people
00:15:06.240 started not running this because snake
00:15:07.680 ey boards AR always just going to be
00:15:09.480 crushed to a super poly so I think that
00:15:11.600 was fair but I think in a new this new
00:15:13.480 format post band list post Legacy of
00:15:15.120 Destruction with melodious tenpai dragon
00:15:17.519 Labyrinth um ubel and then also branded
00:15:21.480 in voiceless voice being the best decks
00:15:23.320 in the room super poly basically crushes
00:15:25.360 most of their boards this also solves
00:15:26.920 the mirror match which the mirror match
00:15:28.199 is very hard so I think Super PO is very
00:15:30.399 good right now I think you should be on
00:15:31.680 super poly if you're running branded if
00:15:33.040 not in the main if not in the side
00:15:34.639 droplet was kind of the go-to last
00:15:36.560 format I think droplet's still amazing
00:15:38.240 but I think it got a little worse with
00:15:39.480 Baron and Savage being banned because
00:15:41.040 the omns are gone so you know and also
00:15:43.680 super poly couldn't really get around
00:15:45.440 those or sit bar in it for the most part
00:15:47.480 so um I think that droplet got a little
00:15:49.920 bit worse in Our Deck but still very
00:15:51.440 good it interacts with our deck a bit
00:15:52.800 more because you can go brand Fusion
00:15:54.800 they go negate you go droplet so very
00:15:57.160 good you can usually get free out of
00:15:59.319 this super poly is always a hard discard
00:16:01.279 one but also it's not once per turn so
00:16:03.160 that's also one of the best parts about
00:16:04.360 super poly it's also an otk machine so
00:16:07.399 very good you can side main them also
00:16:09.279 super poly in terms of targets we will
00:16:11.800 talk about that right now so generally
00:16:14.319 the super poly targets that you're going
00:16:15.720 to be looking out for that you want to
00:16:17.040 run if you're running super poly are
00:16:18.399 gura and mud dragon mud dragon being two
00:16:20.639 Monsters of the same attribute but
00:16:22.160 different typings and then gura being
00:16:24.279 the same type and attribute so these
00:16:26.120 cards if you're running super po I
00:16:27.440 recommend running both uh depending on
00:16:29.160 the format though you can get away with
00:16:30.319 not running one of them though I think
00:16:31.959 that right now during this format I
00:16:33.480 think that mud dragon isn't as needed
00:16:36.040 actually most of the boards like ubal
00:16:38.120 like voiceless like tpai they're all
00:16:40.000 kind of like the same typing not
00:16:41.759 voiceless voiceless was more of a mud
00:16:43.360 dragon build to be fair but gura for the
00:16:45.639 tenpai for the melodus uh very good but
00:16:49.360 for that reason I do recommend both of
00:16:50.959 them gura is also very good with the
00:16:52.399 Nader package because you get to draw
00:16:54.160 one when you send off and then use
00:16:55.959 Maximus so uh my dragon's also very good
00:16:58.319 for dodging per you can chain C dark and
00:17:00.800 also just caul fire to prevent perean
00:17:03.199 princess from targeting very very very
00:17:05.280 very good in our deck also it's a target
00:17:07.160 for albas for super poly so guilty gear
00:17:09.520 freed was being used in infer Noble
00:17:11.400 format if there's ever a warrior format
00:17:13.280 you can use Guilty Gear freed because
00:17:14.880 it's two generic Warriors very good also
00:17:17.640 a pretty good effect for otk miror Jade
00:17:20.160 is our best uh super poly Target
00:17:22.559 generically because all it needs is a
00:17:24.000 fallen of albas if they have the appos
00:17:25.760 at albas chain super poly continue you
00:17:28.319 know break the board with Mir
00:17:31.160 Jade uh you have starving venom dragon
00:17:34.440 which is very good actually because it
00:17:36.120 can go over um 5K damage so it's very
00:17:39.200 good for getting over like a purely or
00:17:40.880 something uh Noir or like other Towers
00:17:43.320 kind of things like the raidraptor
00:17:45.600 towers very good against raid Raptors
00:17:47.280 very very good against raid Raptors this
00:17:48.840 card um I would say that it's not as
00:17:51.600 used right now but it's definitely one
00:17:52.760 of our bar super poly targets because
00:17:54.080 it's just generically too dark since
00:17:55.520 it's very good otk effect masquerade is
00:17:58.440 also very generic because all you need
00:17:59.720 is dpia plus a light or dark so you
00:18:01.280 could do the same thing with albas set
00:18:03.080 dpia you know or you could go Al Luber
00:18:06.240 uh and then you they could go imperm and
00:18:08.400 then you can go super poly and Dodge the
00:18:10.320 imperm Draco stalia is also one of your
00:18:12.520 more generic ones because it's just a
00:18:13.960 dark plus a uh Fusion Monster so a lot
00:18:16.480 of the time in the mirror matches this
00:18:18.200 is very good or just using one of your
00:18:20.120 fusion monsters plus a dark against any
00:18:22.039 dark deck which there's a lot of darks
00:18:23.720 IP mascarena SP L Knight it comes up and
00:18:26.400 then also Boral load Furious dragon one
00:18:28.880 of the best extra Deck cards right now
00:18:30.600 highly recommend it overall also St also
00:18:34.039 stapelia is very good overall because
00:18:36.440 it's plays through shifter so very much
00:18:38.760 recommend running stapelia for getting
00:18:40.720 through shifter if you get shifter a lot
00:18:42.120 of people ask me what do you do you make
00:18:43.559 stapelia or you make draon we'll go over
00:18:45.280 Dragon when we get to it and then borad
00:18:47.679 Furious Dragon very good card you need
00:18:49.360 to be running this right now in my
00:18:50.760 opinion especially if you're running
00:18:52.000 more shr dragon or lot bals it's just
00:18:54.000 two dark dragons so for that reason
00:18:56.240 against uh Centurion when they make
00:18:58.760 oilla or just the mirror match um this
00:19:01.159 card is very much a live super poly
00:19:03.200 Target and then also it's very good
00:19:05.200 against runic stun if you keep this on
00:19:06.559 board runix stun can't do anything about
00:19:08.120 it you basically just keep popping their
00:19:09.600 cards every turn you can chain opening
00:19:11.520 and Target your own fusion monsters with
00:19:13.320 Boral Lo Furious Dragon to Target to
00:19:15.559 destroy one of your own monsters to pop
00:19:17.159 one of their cards on their field your
00:19:18.760 opponent's cards on their field um very
00:19:20.840 good 3,000 beater it's once per turn
00:19:22.400 quick effect so very good you need this
00:19:24.280 or Magnum the reliever but Magnum the
00:19:26.039 reliever isn't a super poly Target so
00:19:27.960 we'll talk about that when we get to it
00:19:29.799 righty so now we're going to talk about
00:19:31.360 the patchwork engine the patchwork
00:19:32.840 engine is really good in my opinion uh
00:19:35.480 in various different use cases it's
00:19:37.559 mainly there for breaking a board but it
00:19:39.960 also helps you play with your hand traps
00:19:41.400 and facilitate some of your other
00:19:43.480 extenders now this is because edgm chain
00:19:46.080 is a dark fiend so this is also going to
00:19:49.400 be able to be used as a lar Darkness
00:19:51.280 fodder and also um brand High Spirits
00:19:55.120 because is a bridge for cerus in order
00:19:56.840 to search out a engine piece is also a
00:19:58.960 really good discard fodder because you
00:20:00.360 can discard for anything including cost
00:20:02.600 like super poly or lelion and get a plus
00:20:04.799 one out of a gy chain to uh keep up your
00:20:07.919 advantage train which is really nice I
00:20:09.799 think the only downside to this package
00:20:11.520 and it's a big downside they're all
00:20:13.039 bricks um however poly allows you to
00:20:15.520 play through hand traps very easily
00:20:16.840 let's just say you got imped on your
00:20:18.200 cesia you can still make Grand winol
00:20:20.039 that way or if you get imped on your
00:20:21.320 albon you still can make miror Jade that
00:20:23.480 way it's not horrible in that respect
00:20:25.440 you know they have their uses but I
00:20:26.840 think that all right so let's talk about
00:20:29.760 Dark Magician in the Dragoon package
00:20:31.880 droon is one of branded only Omni
00:20:35.000 negates in the game I mean once we get
00:20:36.919 Lon Darkness dragon retrains that might
00:20:38.960 change however the draon package has
00:20:41.240 been a tried and true thing since
00:20:42.760 branded came out really to just flow
00:20:44.960 throw a dark magician in there because
00:20:46.600 lubon or elbon for that matter can be
00:20:49.640 can make dark uh Riot's dark draon the
00:20:52.280 Branded fusions are all quite generic in
00:20:54.200 that respect which is super nice so a
00:20:56.480 lot of the time you just throw in this
00:20:57.679 dark magician you send albazin Dark
00:21:00.480 Magician off a brand Fusion you can make
00:21:02.200 the Dragoon now is this good right now
00:21:05.400 I'm not sure I think mostly in casiro
00:21:07.600 format this was quite a good option
00:21:09.120 because Dron is untargetable cannot be
00:21:10.799 destroyed so you could just make this
00:21:12.360 under shifter it's one of your best
00:21:13.840 shifter options by the way you can make
00:21:16.039 this under a rise heart you could pop a
00:21:18.559 and also just break a cur board very
00:21:20.919 easily so it because it has a pop and
00:21:23.760 also is has an omn negate it can go to
00:21:25.720 4K too so it's almost a pseudo towers
00:21:27.880 with its protection
00:21:29.240 and it's um on presence board effect so
00:21:32.120 dra's very good in that respect however
00:21:34.400 I think that what sucks is you have to
00:21:36.080 run the the brick that is dark magician
00:21:38.440 Dark Magician is not horrible is a High
00:21:40.279 Spirits bridge is also a 2500 that you
00:21:42.960 can just get off a fusion fusion
00:21:44.600 deployment was actually quite good
00:21:45.919 against stun decks with like things like
00:21:47.840 Majesty's fiend so you can just go
00:21:49.440 Fusion deployment into Dark Magician run
00:21:51.799 over the fiend and then just proceed to
00:21:53.440 keep playing so not bad in that respect
00:21:55.159 but this isn't quite a format with that
00:21:56.600 kind of deck rolling around all the time
00:21:59.159 so really a niche Case Case so I think
00:22:01.919 that there's other cards like gos of the
00:22:04.039 third eye and the light heck sealed
00:22:05.440 sealed Fusion this is actually the
00:22:06.880 better option for brand espia in
00:22:09.000 particular but this monster basically
00:22:10.720 can sub these monsters can substitute as
00:22:12.799 any one fusion material and the other
00:22:14.880 one must be correct so basically you
00:22:16.600 substitute the Dark Magician for Dragon
00:22:19.080 and then all you need is a dark effect
00:22:21.520 or a dragon effect monster very generic
00:22:23.679 basically you run a bunch of those in
00:22:25.320 your deck so it makes Dragon a lot
00:22:26.880 easier to summon also but the thing is
00:22:29.080 draon needs Dark Magician in order to
00:22:31.279 get its pop effect which is only on your
00:22:33.240 turn so it's not too important but it is
00:22:34.799 a non-targeting destruction and also it
00:22:37.400 burns so it can help you in time for
00:22:39.200 that reason so I think that um you know
00:22:42.039 your light your mileage may vary I think
00:22:43.919 that the thing is about Dragoon is it's
00:22:46.400 really good into shifter and you can't
00:22:48.240 do that with these guys these guys do
00:22:50.000 not work as dark magician unless they're
00:22:52.120 in they're in the graveyard or on the
00:22:53.799 field or in your hand so dark magician
00:22:56.279 no matter what even if it's bash it can
00:22:57.799 be used to make a draon so I that's why
00:22:59.480 I personally prefer the Dark Magician
00:23:01.159 but these guys also can act as Al bazes
00:23:03.159 or for other things like the uh Buster
00:23:04.960 blad or Fusion which a lot of people
00:23:06.200 have been thinking of for tenpai as a
00:23:08.400 way to get around the dragons also for
00:23:09.960 disper now that Baron's ban because now
00:23:12.360 that is the best dragon in the game and
00:23:14.159 also just for the other Dragon decks in
00:23:15.840 general I think that is always an option
00:23:17.960 that you could try out however I don't
00:23:19.120 think it's the best option but that's
00:23:20.559 always something that you can consider
00:23:22.240 these guys who will help you co cover
00:23:24.159 for that these can be the bster Bladers
00:23:26.080 these can be the dark magicians and
00:23:27.400 these can also more important be albes
00:23:30.159 so you maybe only have to run two albes
00:23:32.159 or you just have other names for albes
00:23:33.880 for when your other ones get banished
00:23:35.520 very good options now I'm going to cover
00:23:38.039 the rest of the engine that I feel like
00:23:40.720 is worth it to cover we have first we
00:23:43.799 have branded sword shout out to Raul I'm
00:23:45.760 going to I'm going to link down below a
00:23:47.880 combo video with branded sword branded
00:23:49.440 sword is actually one of the most
00:23:50.360 underrated cards in brand dpia summons a
00:23:52.279 lot of tokens basically by banishing
00:23:54.559 branded spot tribe cards from your
00:23:56.000 graveyard not important second effect is
00:23:57.720 very important it's basically basically
00:23:58.760 a retribution in the graveyard for
00:24:00.720 Branded monsters essentially for
00:24:02.559 monsters that mentioned Fallen of Al baz
00:24:05.039 um so you can match this quick effect
00:24:06.760 get like mercuria that's banished a
00:24:08.360 fallen of albz a caresia a quem that's
00:24:10.440 banished very good also this is a very
00:24:12.679 good combo piece with High Spirits and
00:24:14.520 quem and Bisal so definitely check out
00:24:16.600 the video if you want to see more brand
00:24:18.000 sword I highly recommend it however this
00:24:20.159 takes brand to a whole new level of
00:24:21.840 combo so I don't recommend this for your
00:24:24.080 if you are a ju if you just started
00:24:26.520 unbranded or even if you've been on the
00:24:27.919 deck for a little bit it's definitely
00:24:29.279 the highest level of branded for the
00:24:30.679 most part but it also gives you the
00:24:32.399 highest ceiling possible it gives you
00:24:33.799 the most combo lines and allows you to
00:24:35.520 you can do 30 lines in the end phase
00:24:37.120 essentially with brand swords really
00:24:38.640 crazy check out the video
00:24:40.399 guys hey what's up guys it's me games GX
00:24:43.399 here like with these backpacks a lot of
00:24:45.480 time top just slid it just slid in one
00:24:48.039 so we have the backpack all up I also
00:24:50.679 forgot that there is a have Nice Dice
00:24:53.440 but you know have Nice Dice but
00:24:58.000 [Music]
00:24:59.399 other things are like ad libitum I think
00:25:01.520 ad lib used to be very standard in
00:25:03.360 Brandon you don't see it as standard
00:25:05.039 anymore it's a brick for the most part
00:25:06.880 but it does allow you to have a Grind
00:25:08.360 game past the gimmick puppet for the
00:25:10.320 most part because you obviously can just
00:25:12.399 get a triple mirror Jade on one turn
00:25:14.720 with this card basically without
00:25:15.919 sanctifier so you could go for me Jad
00:25:18.200 with sanctifier it's pretty crazy out
00:25:20.200 here I think that this card is very good
00:25:22.039 in that respect but also it doesn't have
00:25:24.399 the biggest place in brand desia but it
00:25:25.919 does allow you to do certain things like
00:25:27.880 it also do it secondary effect which
00:25:29.520 boosts your uh fusion monsters attack by
00:25:32.000 basically 800 so you can help get over
00:25:34.080 like Towers monsters it's very utility
00:25:36.039 in that case it's also a dark so it
00:25:38.120 helps you know with a lower Darkness
00:25:39.960 it's not a High Spirits Bridge which
00:25:41.559 definitely hurts um but you know it's
00:25:44.000 searchable off of opening it's very
00:25:45.640 searchable in that case off of tragedy
00:25:47.840 and also it's very good just for a very
00:25:49.480 big power play for the most part I find
00:25:51.559 it that by the time I'm resolving ad lib
00:25:53.600 it's never going to be the game deciding
00:25:55.320 factor sometimes it is but for that
00:25:57.360 reason I think most of time it's pretty
00:25:58.760 cutable but it's definitely a good
00:26:00.840 option incredible Ecclesia The Virtuous
00:26:03.520 this card is pretty good it lets you
00:26:05.279 special summon uh quick effect uh and
00:26:07.440 also allows you to special summon if
00:26:09.240 your opponent has more monsters than you
00:26:11.600 do and you can also just special summon
00:26:13.559 by tributing itself one Fallen of alz or
00:26:16.360 one sword Soul monster so it's pretty
00:26:18.399 good for just getting out a fallen of
00:26:19.799 alz not very good though in highle brand
00:26:22.279 dpia wouldn't recommend it then dpia the
00:26:24.880 the Branded this is something that
00:26:26.039 people used to run in branded a lot more
00:26:28.320 more but I think nowadays it's pretty
00:26:30.039 slow it's basically just a searchable
00:26:31.760 poly off of a Luber um but it's a field
00:26:34.279 spell as well but we don't really have
00:26:35.799 that great of a field spell Network we
00:26:37.399 can't really use other field spells very
00:26:38.840 well outside pear Rhino so unless you're
00:26:40.600 doing a tier 11 spild I probably would
00:26:42.159 not be running this but it's definitely
00:26:44.600 an option to help you play through hand
00:26:45.840 traps now some people play more Fusion
00:26:48.000 duplication obviously this is your
00:26:49.520 thrust bridge for going first you can
00:26:51.840 basically Target a brand Fusion after
00:26:53.520 you've gotten thrusted and you set this
00:26:55.600 and then you can proceed to use brand
00:26:57.000 Fusion again it has to be Bel instead of
00:26:58.840 Ash which is super nice too because more
00:27:00.640 ashes than Bells so I think that
00:27:03.039 duplication is very good some people
00:27:04.840 have been debating on running three now
00:27:06.799 though especially to play past um D
00:27:09.399 barrier I think the deer is better in
00:27:10.880 that aspect but definitely is an option
00:27:13.679 but you know also the fact you can
00:27:15.520 Target your opponent's spells and traps
00:27:17.320 it's very good in the mirror for that
00:27:18.480 reason and one of the best cards in the
00:27:20.480 mirror we have flirt Elise here this
00:27:22.679 card has been talked about with the ner
00:27:24.200 package um you can special summon it and
00:27:26.919 then uh basically allows you to negate
00:27:28.960 the effects of once you're on the field
00:27:30.960 also gains 500 uh all make make all your
00:27:34.240 dog Maas gain 500 it's okay it's a ner
00:27:37.159 Target it's also you can spec it off of
00:27:40.480 um Titan clad however I don't think it's
00:27:42.440 very good overall I think it's kind of
00:27:44.320 weak kind of slow and Maximus is way
00:27:46.519 better Keeper of the Dragon magic I
00:27:49.000 think that people used to run this a lot
00:27:51.039 more when branded just came out I
00:27:52.720 obviously can just Speck out or get the
00:27:54.600 poly and it's also just quite a good
00:27:56.840 card because also you get to spec from
00:27:58.960 your graveyard one of the specifically
00:28:00.600 me mentioned materials also so it can
00:28:02.919 potentially be a plus two it's good
00:28:04.600 stats as well it's also a dark it's a
00:28:06.399 dark dragon so it's a really good bridge
00:28:07.840 for High Spirits also you see this more
00:28:09.640 in the prep plant build but overall I
00:28:11.320 don't think it's that great for
00:28:13.039 modern-day branded dby it's also kind of
00:28:14.880 slow you don't if you're going to be
00:28:16.279 running the poly package you probably
00:28:17.640 just want to run the huden but if you're
00:28:19.039 running a p plant build this is probably
00:28:20.720 going to be in instant Fusion is
00:28:22.880 something some people debate on but you
00:28:24.320 don't really have any in engine fusions
00:28:26.440 to go into you can really only go into
00:28:28.240 Dragon which if you're running the super
00:28:29.480 poly package okay maybe especially if
00:28:31.559 you're going to run the Millennium eyes
00:28:33.039 strict but also I think that's way too
00:28:34.600 much commitment your extra deck is so
00:28:36.360 tight as a branded player so you can't
00:28:37.799 really be wasting it on really Niche
00:28:39.559 stuff that you barely go into in like a
00:28:41.000 one of kick Clos is band so you know
00:28:43.720 until we get extender with instant
00:28:45.279 Fusion probably not going to be the play
00:28:46.760 for our deck DD orthos also things like
00:28:49.919 Ros disciple and Ido are things that you
00:28:52.360 can run when gimmick puppet if gimmick
00:28:54.440 puppet ever gets banned in sanctifier
00:28:56.080 still thing as other Tech options or
00:28:58.399 basically does the same thing as gimmick
00:28:59.799 puppet but you can't send it as GN or
00:29:02.279 off a gnal which is why we like puppet
00:29:04.240 this thing is also a lingering effect so
00:29:05.840 it's very deadly if you can get off but
00:29:07.720 you have to send off a brand diffusion
00:29:09.200 essentially to get this thing off Ido is
00:29:11.320 very good against uh flu and it's
00:29:13.279 actually pretty citable right now
00:29:15.279 because obviously it's very good against
00:29:16.679 flu it stops normal summons as well
00:29:19.200 Duality is one of my favorite uh little
00:29:21.360 Tech choices that came out of uh Batts
00:29:23.840 of Legend uh last year it's a quick
00:29:26.600 effect that tributes one L monster
00:29:28.559 special summon light dark monster with
00:29:30.159 from your hand Ora your deck with the
00:29:31.480 same original type and level so
00:29:33.600 basically uh this the biggest bridges
00:29:36.200 that you have with this are with um
00:29:38.360 albon the Branded Dragon to sanctifier
00:29:40.600 very good so you can dodge imperm and
00:29:42.559 get free sanctifier as well as gnal
00:29:45.279 which is even better because gr ggal
00:29:46.880 it's a light spellcaster so that makes
00:29:48.240 you a dark spellcaster which is a
00:29:50.840 Dragoon right as dark dragon so you get
00:29:52.600 free omn indate off of the gnal you get
00:29:54.279 to dodge imp perm very free also it's
00:29:56.320 graveyard effect not once per turn
00:29:58.440 mutually exclusive on both effects so
00:30:00.960 that means you can Target one layer dark
00:30:02.600 monster in your graveyard and dark
00:30:04.200 monster so you get to recur a light and
00:30:06.720 dark very useful and putting back into
00:30:08.559 your deck so you get to reshuffle your M
00:30:10.399 you know Fusion materials or cards you
00:30:12.000 need back in your deck and then you get
00:30:13.120 to draw one card so very free it makes
00:30:15.159 up for the neag and uh gets you back
00:30:17.519 resources very good it's it's a once per
00:30:19.360 turn though so a lot of the time it can
00:30:21.399 be bricky if you run three of these but
00:30:23.039 I think in a format like cash um when
00:30:25.519 you need Dron when Dragoon's really good
00:30:27.240 this card is going to be one of the your
00:30:28.559 best options and it's definitely one of
00:30:30.000 those Tech choices that I think is still
00:30:31.399 underexplored and branded that you can
00:30:32.720 definitely try out if you want to be a
00:30:33.960 little
00:30:34.679 spicy because getting out to an omn
00:30:36.960 neate is super important then also just
00:30:38.480 dodging in perm super good also it's a
00:30:40.440 quick effect so can be used on other
00:30:41.960 turns I think the shuffle back effect is
00:30:43.679 very good because I'm branded a lot of
00:30:45.039 the time um you can go through your
00:30:46.760 resources very easily so uh things like
00:30:49.600 you know using alal lenus to spin back
00:30:51.679 with lelon and Duality and then uh
00:30:54.000 retribution you know spending back to
00:30:55.919 your Fusion materials is very important
00:30:58.399 uh and anything else that can do that
00:30:59.760 including like things like tier laments
00:31:01.200 Hess and shyen which we'll talk about
00:31:02.960 here we have the tier liament um I think
00:31:05.679 that branded back in full power tier
00:31:08.039 limit we really got a lot of kolos you
00:31:10.799 know kolos would be able to Mill five we
00:31:12.399 would Mill tragedy would Mill cart we'd
00:31:14.240 be able to just go off we'd be able to
00:31:16.000 go full branded combo essentially on top
00:31:17.840 of tier limit combo um not So Much
00:31:20.519 Anymore without kolos and all the names
00:31:22.159 that one so I think things like tier
00:31:23.399 liament Hess and tier liament shyon are
00:31:25.600 things that we can actually run at the
00:31:27.200 moment um in order to facilitate certain
00:31:29.799 combo lines and also like I said recur
00:31:32.120 things I think shyon basically acts as a
00:31:34.919 card that can extend and unbrick hands
00:31:37.480 also Mill three so maybe you can Mill a
00:31:39.159 tragedy or something like that but I
00:31:40.799 think more importantly it's effect to
00:31:42.760 basically uh Shuffle back cards uh when
00:31:45.159 it goes to the graveyard is very
00:31:46.320 important so you can go brand Fusion S
00:31:47.919 shyon and albas and you get your miror
00:31:50.320 Jade but you can also fuse again which
00:31:52.519 is very devastating get like something
00:31:54.240 like a masquerade or even a draco
00:31:56.440 stellia um if you have the resources so
00:31:59.559 I think things like tier liit hinness
00:32:01.080 and Sharon are able to facilitate things
00:32:03.000 like masade very well which is good for
00:32:05.039 time and just putting pressure on decks
00:32:06.480 like snake eye which does a lot of uh
00:32:08.679 interaction so they have to burn like
00:32:10.519 for 6,000 life basically before they get
00:32:12.559 rid of the Masquerade which can be very
00:32:14.519 devastating um so I think that you know
00:32:17.000 people have talked about going into
00:32:18.200 double or triple masquerade actually
00:32:19.960 we'll talk about that when we get to
00:32:21.120 masquerade but you know I think the tier
00:32:22.960 limits are there to do that I think it's
00:32:24.519 either Hess or shyon you can maybe even
00:32:26.279 run both I would never on a full tier
00:32:28.519 limit engine right now on branded but
00:32:30.080 you know if you want to cook something
00:32:31.120 up I wouldn't be AOS so multiple people
00:32:33.440 have been trying out branded lost at
00:32:36.440 higher multiples whether in the side or
00:32:38.480 in the main deck now what do I think
00:32:40.480 about this I think brand loss is one of
00:32:41.919 the best cards in brand dpia allows you
00:32:44.519 to make your effects um to be un
00:32:47.559 negatable and then also um also makes it
00:32:51.039 so that they are unresponded which is
00:32:52.720 very devastating you can chain miror
00:32:54.480 Jade to the summon and your opponent
00:32:55.639 can't respond to the ban very good card
00:32:57.320 and a lot of the time it is your
00:32:58.679 One-Stop shot to breaking a board
00:33:00.480 because if you are able to establish
00:33:02.080 loss then you um are able to get through
00:33:04.840 your opponent's uh barded most of the
00:33:07.000 time because they can't negate it
00:33:08.480 however um you only have one loss most
00:33:10.360 in most builds so some people have been
00:33:12.120 trying loss it two or three uh
00:33:14.480 especially last format I think that's an
00:33:16.200 okay option I think overall it's not
00:33:17.799 something I would do personally because
00:33:19.480 of the fact it is still a once per turn
00:33:21.639 card obviously you can grab it back from
00:33:23.440 the graveyard with things like tragedy
00:33:25.039 and retribution as well so I think that
00:33:27.039 kind of defeats the need for multiples
00:33:28.559 but that's an option that you could use
00:33:30.159 for your main or side deck next is PA
00:33:32.840 desires as the last main Deck Tech
00:33:35.159 option I think is something that we've
00:33:37.159 covered on the channel quite a bit
00:33:38.760 actually as of recent it's a very good
00:33:40.320 card pod desires obviously is one of the
00:33:42.279 only generic plus ones left in the game
00:33:44.880 uh that just gives you off the top for
00:33:46.279 free essentially so it's really a
00:33:47.840 consistency booster but the issue is
00:33:49.760 that you banish 10 from the top and if
00:33:51.840 you bash your Al bazes or your branded
00:33:53.760 fusions you start cutting into your
00:33:55.279 grind game so this card could be very
00:33:56.880 devastating either way for you or your
00:33:59.039 opponent I think it depends on the pilot
00:34:01.559 and the build really I've seen anywhere
00:34:03.279 from 40 to 60 cards run with po desires
00:34:05.679 I technically I usually recommend pod
00:34:07.760 desires to be random builds um over 50
00:34:10.960 cards because elsewise you will be
00:34:12.719 banishing all your alaz is all your fall
00:34:15.359 all your brand fusions just coming off
00:34:16.839 your grinding game way too hard but this
00:34:18.440 is sometimes the only card that you can
00:34:19.800 use to fill out your deck to 60 cards
00:34:21.520 and increase that consistency also a
00:34:23.679 decent thrust Target really good going
00:34:25.280 second so good card overall all righty
00:34:28.839 so now we're going to get into the extra
00:34:31.040 deck options and I think that we won't
00:34:34.760 cover really the standard but we'll talk
00:34:36.800 about different things you can do to
00:34:39.040 Tech out your extra Deck with different
00:34:40.800 cards or even different ratios of
00:34:43.119 standards that we're used to so I think
00:34:45.320 we can start off with the basics you
00:34:47.480 know we can talk about gr wignall we can
00:34:49.839 talk about miror Jade I think Mir Jade
00:34:52.079 you obviously want to run two of that's
00:34:53.918 very standard but gr wignall is
00:34:55.719 something that hasn't been very standard
00:34:57.280 at two
00:34:58.480 um but I think that it should be going
00:35:00.560 forward grwi at 2 allows you to have so
00:35:02.920 much more combo lines it allows you to
00:35:04.359 make a gr wial on your turn and then a
00:35:06.000 gr wial on your opponent's turn which is
00:35:07.640 usually the best thing to make off a
00:35:08.839 cesia it's the best way to loot Mir Jade
00:35:11.480 with quem as well by just fusing away
00:35:13.440 the Mir Jade after you've used its
00:35:14.920 effect bring it back with quem two Mir
00:35:16.960 Jades bam and you can really only do
00:35:18.880 that with a second Grand wial obviously
00:35:20.839 a um stellia could sometimes do that but
00:35:23.920 then you have to kind of commit a lot
00:35:25.680 harder I think running one means that
00:35:27.920 you cut off a lot too many combo lines
00:35:30.000 for the deck it cuts off your ability to
00:35:31.760 make branded Fusion a true onecard
00:35:33.720 gimmick lock you just need a discard
00:35:35.839 obviously but you know that's pretty
00:35:37.839 good having a one card gimmick lock out
00:35:39.440 branded Fusion your best card in the
00:35:41.000 deck the most easily accessible one card
00:35:43.200 combo in the deck so this should be
00:35:45.680 going forward at two and it's very good
00:35:47.720 and it justifies why the price is going
00:35:49.680 up on this thing you have things like
00:35:51.359 qutis um this has been quite standard
00:35:54.000 but I think right now things like Lulu
00:35:56.000 wall Lilith is actually kind of better
00:35:57.920 than cerus cerus is quite good against
00:35:59.640 Rogue but I think against all the top
00:36:01.240 decks for the most part cerus kind of
00:36:02.839 just gets either bounced or slotted by
00:36:05.599 like a a flame Burge so I think that
00:36:07.319 cerus is actually the weakest it's been
00:36:08.920 a while and I think that um Lulu wall
00:36:11.680 Lilith is a card that combos very well
00:36:14.240 with nir servant it's also a Omni negate
00:36:16.520 for one face up card basically when a
00:36:18.400 card leaves the extra deck so basically
00:36:20.280 it can stop tenpai because you can bring
00:36:22.359 it out through gr wial these two
00:36:24.000 monsters usually come through uh gr
00:36:25.920 gal's floating effect when your
00:36:27.240 opponent's special summons a monster
00:36:28.440 through a monster effect so um Lulu is a
00:36:31.119 lot better against most of the metad
00:36:32.400 decks in most use cases because it will
00:36:34.640 give you that negate and stop your
00:36:35.960 opponent from comboing off it also gives
00:36:37.760 all your monsters plus 500 permanently
00:36:40.119 which can come over come up against
00:36:42.200 things like purely other Towers decks
00:36:43.880 but I think quitus is quite good and I
00:36:45.440 would really good super poly Target
00:36:47.319 because one light or dark it's also
00:36:48.680 quite good in The Grind game against and
00:36:50.200 it can really just seal the deal against
00:36:51.680 rogue deck so these are definitely your
00:36:53.280 options but Lulu is quite nice like I
00:36:55.240 said with nider serving you can get any
00:36:56.760 light spell cast basically from your
00:36:58.400 deck with equal attack and defense so
00:36:59.800 qumer cartisia nface super good super
00:37:01.960 good and also it lets you play through
00:37:03.240 things like Synchro Zone because you can
00:37:05.319 har make this on turn two and three with
00:37:07.440 just like a quem and Like A Mir Jade now
00:37:09.599 you have things like triple or double
00:37:11.720 masquerade I think that masr I mentioned
00:37:14.480 this kind of earlier it's quite a good
00:37:16.160 option against Bad players and then also
00:37:18.599 just Decks that use a lot of interaction
00:37:20.640 such as Snake Eyes so I think that
00:37:22.480 having something like a double or triple
00:37:24.319 masquerade might be an option especially
00:37:26.319 if sanctifier ever gets banned and but I
00:37:28.079 think for right now running one is
00:37:30.119 pretty good running two or three is kind
00:37:31.760 of getting overboard but you know you do
00:37:33.440 have these options to make your opponent
00:37:35.079 basically burn through their whole life
00:37:37.079 if you don't want to go with the gimmick
00:37:38.160 puer outout oh that's Alti I
00:37:44.839 forgot other Tech extra deck options
00:37:47.480 include oh my mic was unmuted my
00:37:50.319 bad I'm recording a video other Tech
00:37:53.480 extra deck options include two Guardian
00:37:55.560 Chimera in order to deal with the stun
00:37:57.880 prevalence now over the last month or
00:37:59.960 two stun has become extraordinary force
00:38:02.720 in Yu-Gi-Oh that if you don't come
00:38:04.880 prepared you are going to lose there is
00:38:06.880 a few options that you can use to go
00:38:08.400 over stun that'll go over right now I
00:38:10.200 think two Guardian chra piloted by Sam
00:38:12.319 Jen is very good um because you go into
00:38:15.240 one G CH one in one turn clear their
00:38:17.839 board and then have a second for when
00:38:19.560 they reestablish um g c is one of your
00:38:22.839 best outs in branded for just getting
00:38:24.960 over spells and traps very good also you
00:38:27.040 have things like Magnum the reliever
00:38:28.760 alongside Boral Lo Furious Dragon Magnum
00:38:31.720 the reliever can be easily made off of
00:38:33.400 cesia or brand red and this thing
00:38:35.160 basically says draw a card and you can
00:38:37.119 pop a card and it's really good that you
00:38:38.920 can recycle your poly your fusions very
00:38:41.119 good especially with the patchwork
00:38:42.240 engine I think you need like any
00:38:44.480 combination of these uh in order plus
00:38:47.800 Boral in order to play against stun at a
00:38:49.760 minimum right now I think you also have
00:38:51.720 smaller options like SP little Knight if
00:38:53.680 you want to have a better Grind game
00:38:56.040 this is a smaller option SP L Knight can
00:38:58.520 be ran Our Deck it would just be as a
00:39:00.160 turn two or three thing to out uh
00:39:03.560 floodgates then you also have sprin spr
00:39:06.200 is a good out for floodgates as well
00:39:08.079 it's also a decent uh Tech with brand
00:39:10.480 High Spirits because you can go brand
00:39:12.000 High Spirits with gimmick puppin hand
00:39:13.839 send the spry and set gimmick puppet
00:39:15.520 that way very specific but it's also
00:39:17.400 specs out kit so it's nice with
00:39:22.800 that other various extra deck options
00:39:25.640 include brigand for when you want to get
00:39:28.160 a mercuria in the end phase also your
00:39:30.480 monsters become untargetable so it's
00:39:32.200 very good in a format with like runic or
00:39:33.880 casir it's also pretty good for the one
00:39:36.119 card gimmick lock to send off a
00:39:39.040 bopus you also have things like dusp and
00:39:41.960 proon it's very good as a super poly
00:39:44.520 Target it's also very good against the
00:39:45.880 fire deck because you can Target the
00:39:47.160 Promethean princess and also disrupt
00:39:49.160 graveyard very good but then you have
00:39:51.800 Mysterion the Dragon Crown this card was
00:39:54.040 brought up um I believe by gzo like a
00:39:56.720 few few months ago I personally don't
00:39:58.880 love this card but it's definitely an
00:40:00.720 option um it's a lot of tech so it can
00:40:03.400 go up to a really big guy for all the
00:40:04.760 bash cards and then also it's pretty
00:40:06.400 good against snake eye overall so not a
00:40:09.359 bad option for that but personally I
00:40:11.079 wouldn't run it it's a bit specific you
00:40:13.520 have the shadal cards you could always
00:40:15.640 um construct really is a High Spirits
00:40:17.560 Bridge it's not bad if you want like
00:40:19.520 High Spirits Bridge with spellcast or
00:40:21.880 with fairies it's not bad and then also
00:40:23.960 there's W as well uh these aren't the
00:40:27.520 greatest options they aren't really
00:40:28.760 branded cards and also for the if you
00:40:32.119 want Nader to be better going second
00:40:34.240 it's not bad at all to pop a card and
00:40:36.880 then you have the horn sorus this card
00:40:38.560 has been more of a tech card to really
00:40:40.400 search out a field spell you could use
00:40:42.079 this to search out um zombie world the
00:40:44.599 despian theater stuff like that went s
00:40:47.040 to the graveyard through like gr gual so
00:40:50.720 let's go over some extra Deck Tech
00:40:54.079 option I think overall things like droll
00:40:57.400 nib are the best side deck uh hand traps
00:41:00.000 in branded because they are the most
00:41:01.920 high impact so I think these will be the
00:41:04.839 hand traps you put in first for Branded
00:41:06.720 I mean imper Ash are nice but like they
00:41:08.760 kind of only stop one or two things if
00:41:11.040 you want if you're running hand traps in
00:41:12.640 branded you want to be meaningful uh
00:41:14.720 because you can't really afford to spend
00:41:16.160 your whole engine on hand trap so I
00:41:17.920 think these two are the ones to run I
00:41:20.200 think it's more conducive to run hand
00:41:21.800 traps and branded when you're more of a
00:41:23.640 closer to a 40 card build than a 60 card
00:41:25.800 build so these are things to consider in
00:41:27.560 builds like that um other hand traps
00:41:29.760 like Ashen imperm like I said you could
00:41:31.359 run but you want to run an extensive
00:41:32.920 package maybe in like a 60 card build at
00:41:34.760 40 card you can't afford all those hand
00:41:36.440 traps you can really only afford nine at
00:41:40.280 most I did mention before Zombie World
00:41:42.920 and bansi this has been very brand in
00:41:45.800 branded you have branded Fusion which
00:41:47.839 can send basically any card from your
00:41:50.040 deck to the graveyard effectively in the
00:41:51.960 Monster card so you can run things like
00:41:53.760 necro World Banshee which combos you can
00:41:55.880 send it off of making l Bellon and you
00:41:57.960 can basically Tech out a Zombie World
00:41:59.720 immediately which is very good against
00:42:01.880 decks like flu against any dragon deck
00:42:03.920 like 10pi it's very good against because
00:42:06.160 they basically need to have their typing
00:42:07.880 correct or else they can't really
00:42:09.280 function so these are very uh good for
00:42:12.160 extra deck option two card commitment as
00:42:14.200 well that's what you're really looking
00:42:15.440 for with your side deck with branded you
00:42:17.440 want cards that overperform that cover a
00:42:20.040 lot of matchups and this can be very
00:42:21.800 good in a certain when there's a lot of
00:42:23.640 flu going around I think shadal dragon
00:42:26.559 is one of the side deck cards and
00:42:28.160 branded dpia overall it's another dark
00:42:31.280 that you can just send off of making L
00:42:32.640 Bellion with branded fusion and
00:42:34.119 basically you can go chain link one
00:42:35.359 lelion chain link two branded or shid
00:42:37.240 doall Dragon to chain block the lub
00:42:39.160 Bellion but more importantly you're
00:42:40.640 going to be basically uh even under
00:42:42.520 skill drain you can basically pop a
00:42:44.359 skill drain with chid all Dragon because
00:42:46.040 it's activating in the graveyard and
00:42:47.319 then you can go on to fuse very good for
00:42:49.000 getting around um very good for getting
00:42:51.280 round stun also you can fuse off with a
00:42:54.880 summon off a sanctifier it's very good
00:42:56.920 ALS so you can pitch off a opening and
00:42:58.520 then it can trigger it's just interacts
00:43:00.520 in Our Deck very well you can banish off
00:43:02.440 of of Aur as
00:43:04.680 well I think overall in branded dpia you
00:43:07.800 want to be running spells and trap NE
00:43:10.079 removal removal because you have trouble
00:43:13.079 as a branded player you don't have any
00:43:14.720 in engine way to out spells and traps
00:43:16.760 that are like floodgates that are like
00:43:18.559 continuous so I think we overide a
00:43:21.640 little bit for that in general I think
00:43:24.079 things like evenly feather duster and
00:43:25.640 lightning storm are what you want to
00:43:26.800 look at especially with Baron and Savage
00:43:28.480 now being um Bann that these cards are
00:43:31.760 infinitely free especially evenly I
00:43:33.599 think evenly is the best branded board
00:43:35.280 breaker in the game generally besides
00:43:37.000 feather duster but evenly gets around a
00:43:38.960 whole board it also um it just puts in a
00:43:42.160 lot of punch uh and it works very well
00:43:44.400 in Our Deck because we don't run hand
00:43:46.040 traps and evenly can be very awkward
00:43:47.800 with hand traps um so it's very free in
00:43:50.280 Our Deck it's also a Thrust Target
00:43:51.800 that's what you want to look for with a
00:43:53.040 lot of these side deck cards you want to
00:43:54.200 see if they're thrust targets that's why
00:43:55.800 a branded side deck a lot of time you
00:43:57.920 will see a lot of one ofes because you
00:43:59.480 can just Thrust out thrust them out
00:44:01.920 thrust search them out going second um
00:44:04.440 feather duster very free it's at one you
00:44:06.160 would run more but it's just very free
00:44:08.079 very crucial in certain matchups and
00:44:09.599 lightning storm is very good it's very
00:44:11.280 free again with the Omni negates and it
00:44:13.760 also has a um aspect where you can get
00:44:16.599 around monsters as well lightning storm
00:44:19.000 is very
00:44:21.760 good for more General board breakers for
00:44:25.319 more General board Breakers you things
00:44:27.520 like Dark Ruler no more I actually main
00:44:30.119 this back in castura format because you
00:44:32.280 couldn't really use droplet but for
00:44:33.960 right now I think it's basically a side
00:44:36.000 Deck card because droplet is a better
00:44:38.559 main Deck card you can go it going first
00:44:40.839 you can use it going first whereas Dark
00:44:42.480 Ruler you can only use going second for
00:44:44.319 the most part but it's very good because
00:44:46.040 you're running gimmick puppet so the
00:44:47.599 damage aspect not killing your opponent
00:44:49.640 doesn't matter you're just going to need
00:44:50.920 to get around and break their board and
00:44:52.760 then set up gimmick puppet so Dark Ruler
00:44:55.000 actually fits in really nicely in Our
00:44:56.480 Deck I love it as a one of just a Thrust
00:44:58.839 out and branded it's amazing like that
00:45:01.040 gets over a lot of your toughest
00:45:02.559 matchups like a lot of those melodious
00:45:04.319 boards with a lot of omni negates right
00:45:06.240 now gets over that keeping with the
00:45:09.119 theme more generic board Breakers we're
00:45:10.760 going to look at change of heart mind
00:45:12.040 control um and also like I guess talents
00:45:15.119 can go into this category I think these
00:45:16.760 cards that allow you to take one of your
00:45:18.640 opponent's cards are very good and
00:45:20.240 basically any deck right now but I think
00:45:22.040 chinah heart going onto an Appo or a
00:45:23.960 mind control onto an Appo is just nuts
00:45:26.440 right now because a lot of those decks
00:45:27.880 just don't have an omn negate and the
00:45:29.920 ones that do you'll be able to burn up
00:45:31.400 the omn negate at least just on a non
00:45:33.240 once per turn like mind control or
00:45:34.960 change of heart so you're going to be
00:45:36.319 able to you know you can draw
00:45:37.640 combinations change of heart mind
00:45:38.839 control and like tactics and basically
00:45:40.359 just break a whole board basically um
00:45:43.079 they're very good and I hope that change
00:45:45.040 heart goes to three I would never man
00:45:47.520 these cards because I think tactics is a
00:45:49.040 bit more proactive but definitely side
00:45:50.800 deck them I mean mind controls at three
00:45:53.079 it's not once per turn it's very good
00:45:54.920 something that you can definitely
00:45:55.839 consider obviously you can't link off
00:45:58.440 your opponent's cards but you can go Mir
00:46:00.559 Jade banish the card you take with mind
00:46:02.240 control in the end phase and then also
00:46:03.960 just get the thing off the board by
00:46:05.400 tributing off with like a bestial or
00:46:07.680 something I think with 10p dragon a lot
00:46:10.440 of people are looking for outs for them
00:46:12.440 even though Our Deck has one of the best
00:46:14.000 10p matchups because we have gimmick
00:46:15.880 puppet in our main so they're going to
00:46:17.079 make us go first anyways and we can just
00:46:18.960 gimmick lock them as long as they don't
00:46:20.680 see the correct board Breakers and hand
00:46:22.559 traps we are usually good so the deck
00:46:24.480 usually ends up being a buy for us but I
00:46:26.240 think that people consider things like
00:46:27.920 threatening Roar it's a Thrust Target
00:46:29.599 your opponent cannot declare attack this
00:46:31.040 turn so basically it gets around 10 pi
00:46:33.240 otk and they really can't set up too
00:46:35.400 much of a board that you can't crack so
00:46:37.200 it's not bad but I think it's a bit too
00:46:38.720 specific it's only good against 10p so I
00:46:40.760 think you would rather look at things
00:46:42.040 like d barrier which allows you to have
00:46:44.720 a better matchup against some of your
00:46:46.480 worst matchups like the miror or purely
00:46:48.720 so I think D barrier will actually help
00:46:51.079 you a lot um also just it's a Thrust
00:46:53.440 Target so you if you get hand trapped
00:46:55.160 great I go thrust D barrier a turn skip
00:46:57.599 my opponent sometimes it's better than
00:46:59.119 getting the fusion duplication so um I
00:47:01.480 think it's very strong and you need to
00:47:02.760 be running as a one of you could also
00:47:04.280 run cross out as well right now because
00:47:06.720 cross out's very good at the moment um
00:47:09.160 cross out's very good at the moment
00:47:10.640 because of the fact that you have you
00:47:12.520 can get round D barrier on your
00:47:14.319 opponent's turn cross out's very good
00:47:16.559 right now because you can get around D
00:47:17.800 barrier which is really nice um because
00:47:20.520 every deck is right now running uh D
00:47:22.599 barrier for the 10p matchup so I think
00:47:24.680 that either running cross out or things
00:47:26.280 like deer servant um in order to play
00:47:29.559 past the um the D barrier is very
00:47:32.839 important right now I think ner allows
00:47:34.520 you to play past D barrier quite well
00:47:36.680 because they can de barrier you and then
00:47:38.440 you'll go into deer and still be able to
00:47:40.200 play on your opponent's turn I think
00:47:41.400 it's very easy on that respect and you
00:47:43.040 can side deck this as well don't worry
00:47:44.760 if you aren main decking it just side
00:47:46.079 deck theer for your going first card
00:47:47.640 it's very good I think then you have
00:47:49.319 more obscure things like uh the blackout
00:47:51.720 laughs which is actually one of the
00:47:53.640 newer cards it's a generic it's a Thrust
00:47:55.920 Target it's also a really good discard
00:47:57.520 fodder because on the field basically
00:47:59.119 you can declare a name your opponent
00:48:00.319 can't special summon anything except for
00:48:01.800 the graveyard with that name um or any
00:48:04.359 card with that name except for them
00:48:05.720 graveyard and then you can pitch it in
00:48:07.119 the graveyard and then you can Bish it
00:48:08.720 your opponent can't use effects on field
00:48:10.160 with that card's name so it's very good
00:48:12.240 very free good negation it's a decent
00:48:14.599 thrust Target I think it's just a really
00:48:16.640 good discard fder it's a really good
00:48:18.240 side Deck card because you can it's kind
00:48:20.240 of like chain disappearance or you can
00:48:21.920 just basically nail one of your
00:48:23.760 opponent's monsters and they just can't
00:48:25.200 use it anymore I think chain
00:48:26.359 disappearance was kind of a worse
00:48:27.920 version of black o laughs this can kind
00:48:29.559 of get things like Snake Eyes Ash Poplar
00:48:32.400 um stuff like that um and it's a uh
00:48:35.359 thrust Target but I think that um black
00:48:37.599 out laughs is way better than chain just
00:48:39.280 appearance will ever be in this deck
00:48:41.359 also it's a Luber lore card like you got
00:48:43.880 to run it right so more obscure things
00:48:46.319 we have outs for purely SL Towers decks
00:48:49.079 because we do have a difficult matchup
00:48:51.559 with Towers decks so we have things like
00:48:53.440 lava Golem radian and then heral of the
00:48:55.640 Abyss
00:48:57.680 by that extension you have things like
00:48:59.079 raw sphere mode um I think these things
00:49:01.720 are actually pretty good especially when
00:49:03.200 purely is a very good deck or things
00:49:05.200 like raid Raptor but for right now I
00:49:07.040 don't think we need it but in the past
00:49:08.920 I've known been known to run actually
00:49:10.760 these three cards I think haral best is
00:49:12.440 actually a very good safe um kind of
00:49:14.680 just like a safe lock kind of thing that
00:49:16.400 you can have in your side deck just for
00:49:19.040 in case you play purely and it's pretty
00:49:21.119 General too so you can just declare any
00:49:23.160 monster type and send to the graveyard
00:49:25.119 so it can be pretty good just against
00:49:26.280 you can call Appo right you can call a
00:49:28.319 problem monster pretty easily um
00:49:30.680 Raiden's pretty good because it's a dark
00:49:32.599 so you and it's a fiend so you know uh
00:49:35.119 it's pretty good for that and then lava
00:49:36.599 Golem you don't need your normal summon
00:49:37.920 all the time so this can blow out like a
00:49:39.640 purely player pretty easily things like
00:49:41.839 uh Bisal in the side are pretty good
00:49:43.799 against voiceless against the mirror um
00:49:46.319 not so much against the fire decks
00:49:47.799 anymore but I think against in the side
00:49:49.640 deck they have a pretty good place there
00:49:51.960 also helps just like your engine things
00:49:53.920 like snatch steel as well for taking
00:49:55.799 control I think this is also a Thrust or
00:49:58.880 sorry it's a purely out too because it
00:50:00.960 actually gets around the unaffected
00:50:02.200 nature of cards because it will keep
00:50:03.640 targeting so your opponent will be
00:50:04.880 forced to spin it's very good it's also
00:50:06.920 no restrictions so you can attack with
00:50:08.280 the monster it's very free you also have
00:50:10.119 secret Village of the spellcasters this
00:50:11.920 might be a thing that we go to Once
00:50:13.680 gimmick puppet is Ban or banned or
00:50:15.359 sanctifier is banned because you run a
00:50:17.200 bunch of spellcasters so this card's
00:50:18.760 quite free we might start running some
00:50:20.559 of those field spell Bridges like uh
00:50:22.720 Cleopatra or whatever Soul release was a
00:50:26.319 side Deck card that basically everyone
00:50:27.920 was running at the beginning of fire
00:50:29.559 format but I think as things have slowly
00:50:31.920 developed it's one of those things kind
00:50:33.319 of like threatening Roar where it's a
00:50:34.480 bit too specific against that matchup
00:50:36.720 and not good enough against any other
00:50:38.319 matchup so it's kind of just fallen out
00:50:40.079 of favor for other cards such as ghost
00:50:42.119 Bell Bisal or even board Breakers just
00:50:44.720 to deal with the the deck or hand traps
00:50:48.000 rather because a lot of the fire decks
00:50:49.680 are now just on like a hand rip version
00:50:52.280 anyway it's good though because you can
00:50:54.240 Target a Promethea you can Bish a bunch
00:50:55.960 of um fire fire cards in the graveyard
00:50:57.640 it's not bad but it's a Thrust Target so
00:50:59.559 as a one of I approve but elsewise don't
00:51:02.040 run it you have Dino wrestler panker
00:51:04.119 Toops which is one of the best board
00:51:05.760 Breakers in the game it's quick effect
00:51:07.440 you can basically tribute itself and
00:51:09.440 then you can destroy a card on the field
00:51:11.079 Target anything destroy it so it gets
00:51:12.680 over things like skill drain it's one of
00:51:14.040 the best cards in our deck in my opinion
00:51:15.559 it's also a sanctifier in terms of our
00:51:17.720 side deck and it's also a sanctifier
00:51:19.559 Target so you can just keep bring it
00:51:20.839 back popping cards on your opponent side
00:51:22.200 field it's very good I think right now
00:51:23.760 it's kind of doesn't line up right now
00:51:25.760 for the meta but Ms metas it definitely
00:51:28.720 does ghost Oger is quite good against
00:51:31.200 all these field spell decks right now
00:51:33.119 especially against gimmick puppets
00:51:34.799 coming up and then a lot of field spells
00:51:36.680 are just being overtuned so if you're
00:51:38.160 running a hand trap package that's
00:51:39.920 something that you can consider
00:51:41.079 alongside a gamma gamma's pretty good in
00:51:43.880 De because obviously we go brand Fusion
00:51:45.480 then you can go gamma if they go Ash but
00:51:47.160 the thing is it's at one now so you
00:51:48.920 could run things like Delta as well to
00:51:51.240 get around things like original snake
00:51:53.640 eye sinful spoil um I do have my Delta
00:51:56.280 just have in front of me so unfortunate
00:51:58.440 but you know uh also against tenpai
00:52:01.000 there's the battle phase Epsilon I don't
00:52:02.839 recommend that one but I think Delta's
00:52:04.319 pretty good actually overall also the
00:52:06.720 thing about ghost ogre too which is
00:52:08.200 really cool it's kind of like mercu it's
00:52:10.240 can be it can be used on the field as
00:52:11.799 well so it's a good sanctifier Target
00:52:13.520 you can keep bringing it back and then
00:52:14.559 popping cards on your opponent side of
00:52:15.720 the field when they activate an effect
00:52:17.920 some more thrust targets I want to talk
00:52:20.240 about are magic deflector in destructive
00:52:23.119 DaRuMa Cannon um I think that magical
00:52:26.920 deflector is very good against things
00:52:29.160 like runic against the snake eye deck
00:52:31.040 even turns up off the quick play or the
00:52:34.079 field spells it's in terms of that it's
00:52:36.359 good against um Fire King rather not
00:52:38.760 against the snake eye variant but it's
00:52:40.079 good against runic as well so it's a
00:52:42.040 pretty good just um side Deck card there
00:52:44.559 I think Brest blazing Bron King is
00:52:46.440 usually just better for us because it's
00:52:47.920 even more searchable though destructive
00:52:49.799 DaRuMa Canon though this card is very
00:52:51.880 good it gets around a lot of your Towers
00:52:54.040 issues however I think it's just been
00:52:55.559 ruled so that your opponent needs to be
00:52:57.440 able to flip a monster if they're going
00:52:59.280 to be sending a monster uh that can't be
00:53:01.440 flipped uh to the graveyard so makes it
00:53:04.599 a little bit worse but definitely an
00:53:06.520 option to have against certain decks um
00:53:08.920 like tow decks or it was good against
00:53:10.640 cashier format you would just flip their
00:53:12.319 whole board and then continue I think
00:53:14.240 book of eclipse might be better for that
00:53:15.760 reason but also this is a Thrust Target
00:53:18.240 so it has its merits for that reason I
00:53:20.760 think running thing something like an
00:53:22.079 imperm as well as a Thrust Target isn't
00:53:24.240 horrible in certain formats also if
00:53:25.960 you're already running an imper Mash
00:53:28.040 like nib package that's also my favorite
00:53:30.079 hand trap package in branded speaking of
00:53:32.720 hand traps Fantastical dragon fantasme
00:53:36.000 is theoretically a really good card and
00:53:38.000 branded it's a dark dragon so it's a
00:53:39.640 very good bridge for High Spirits it's
00:53:41.040 also just a dark ver or a darkness and a
00:53:43.160 dark dragon so it's good for Boral but
00:53:45.559 it's a pretty good link or effect to
00:53:47.359 basically draw and reshape your hand it
00:53:49.359 has an anti- targeting effect but it's
00:53:51.240 basically only an anti- Link Card so
00:53:53.559 it's only going to get mileage against
00:53:54.920 link decks which are good right now but
00:53:57.160 also a lot of the decks are currently
00:53:58.359 going into synchros and other extra
00:54:00.119 monsters besides links including Snake
00:54:02.200 Eyes so at the moment I think fantasma
00:54:03.839 is a bit too much of a niche case card
00:54:06.280 but it's definitely there for when there
00:54:07.680 are link decks and we have issues with
00:54:09.359 link decks for when we have issues with
00:54:11.680 link decks did you know branded can run
00:54:13.760 floodgates we have deck lockdown tikaboo
00:54:16.720 and uh other cards that you could run
00:54:19.440 you could even run skild drain if you
00:54:20.799 want to um tikaboo used to be our best
00:54:24.119 uh Floodgate because we basically always
00:54:26.400 play around tikaboo uh we don't we run a
00:54:29.040 bunch of different types basically and
00:54:31.559 it's at one now so you could run as the
00:54:33.520 one of but it's a bit too random and a
00:54:35.760 lot of our decks are over 40 cards so
00:54:37.240 it's not worth it I think deck lockdown
00:54:38.720 is a bit more viable you can run at
00:54:40.359 Three play it going first or even going
00:54:42.799 second but I I wouldn't play going
00:54:44.839 second um it's pretty good it's also um
00:54:48.839 it turns off your cards though too so I
00:54:50.720 don't typically like these types of
00:54:51.920 floodgates to play around hand traps I
00:54:53.880 prefer things like Nader servant siding
00:54:56.040 in is it's more proactive and still does
00:54:57.880 the same thing where it helps you play
00:54:58.920 through hand traps I think things like
00:55:01.240 cross out designator as well is very
00:55:03.559 good in the game this is another way to
00:55:05.359 play around Ash it's either this or
00:55:07.880 tactics thrust I think this is a bit
00:55:10.119 worse though it's better in the mirror
00:55:11.880 match but thrust is a lot more proactive
00:55:14.280 it get card Advantage whereas this just
00:55:16.559 makes you go neg it can go against any
00:55:18.720 card it's very good against DeBerry
00:55:20.200 right now you can call any card it's
00:55:21.520 very versatile it's very good in the
00:55:22.680 mirror like I said but the mirror isn't
00:55:24.000 prominent enough for me to say oh it's
00:55:25.720 way better than thrust so definitely
00:55:27.760 there but it's very good as a side deck
00:55:29.319 option as well for the D Barry or any
00:55:31.160 other
00:55:32.079 things then you have things like Cosmic
00:55:34.280 Cyclone twin twister for your other
00:55:36.280 quick play um board breakers for spells
00:55:39.359 and traps I think these are the best
00:55:40.640 spells and trap remove spell and trap
00:55:42.119 removal and branded besides the board
00:55:43.640 Breakers I showed you before uh twin
00:55:46.200 twister is a bit less free in your deck
00:55:47.680 because discarding card can start
00:55:49.359 sometimes be harsh when a lot of your
00:55:50.720 effects already have a lot of discard
00:55:52.720 cost associated with them but I think
00:55:54.720 Cosmic for that reason also gets hugan
00:55:56.839 which is quite good so I think that
00:55:58.160 Cosmic is usually our play but I think
00:55:59.839 both are quite viable right now and also
00:56:02.240 quite necessary against stun deck so if
00:56:04.599 you're not running these in your side
00:56:05.839 deck you are just going to get you know
00:56:07.520 have a Floodgate flipped on you and die
00:56:09.200 basically I mean a lot of those
00:56:10.280 floodgates went to one but you know that
00:56:11.799 concept still stands especially with
00:56:13.280 runic Fon with the one ofs I think you
00:56:15.520 have other various things like DD Crow
00:56:17.319 and gohost spell I think bestial are
00:56:19.240 generally Better In Our Deck uh decro
00:56:21.480 isn't strong enough right now in this
00:56:22.680 met and ghost spell also can be good
00:56:24.839 with like nib in combination for fire
00:56:26.839 decks but I think overall like you
00:56:28.480 should probably be running board
00:56:29.520 Breakers and branded but D Crow can be
00:56:32.039 there it's definitely a good General
00:56:33.440 option it is a dark as well so it's good
00:56:35.599 against purely which is one of your
00:56:36.799 worst matchups so definitely things to
00:56:38.880 consider and also uh ghost ball is good
00:56:40.920 against Lab at that point I'd probably
00:56:42.599 run Ash though but you know you got
00:56:44.200 consider with Ash with hea going around
00:56:46.240 you know you don't just want to give
00:56:47.480 your it's basically die against fire
00:56:49.039 decks and then dark hole was something
00:56:51.319 that we actually like things like RI
00:56:52.960 darkhole are pretty good actually in Our
00:56:54.359 Deck because we have thrust so we can
00:56:55.760 just easily search them out and also it
00:56:57.720 can just like clearly just clear a field
00:57:00.359 not once per turn so very good you can
00:57:02.359 just keep activating them a lot of decks
00:57:04.200 have destruction protection though
00:57:06.079 that's what the issue with like darkhole
00:57:07.400 and REI is um darkhole was used in our
00:57:10.039 deck for the IBL lock though because it
00:57:11.760 got over the IBL not many iies going
00:57:14.039 around so I think rieki is basically
00:57:15.760 better right now and then our last side
00:57:18.119 Deck card is Spellbound I think
00:57:20.079 Spellbound and D barrier kind of go hand
00:57:22.000 inand I think Spellbound can be used
00:57:23.559 going second though which is kind of
00:57:25.240 neat um but it's only with the monsters
00:57:27.280 on the field at the moment so I
00:57:28.839 typically think that D barrier is better
00:57:30.839 especially since it's a Thrust Target
00:57:32.760 but if you really know your matchups and
00:57:34.880 like were to hit a deck out with Spell
00:57:36.200 bound I think it's definitely a tech
00:57:37.799 option that you can use um I just think
00:57:40.160 it kind of just isn't proactive enough
00:57:41.960 and that's what you need to be looking
00:57:43.119 at when you're looking at these Tech
00:57:44.400 options especially in the side deck for
00:57:45.880 Branded are they proactive for the deck
00:57:47.640 do they make me go a neg do they
00:57:49.039 generate me Advantage as well be is
00:57:51.079 covering a wide swath of decks well so
00:57:53.880 you got to consider in the when you're
00:57:55.640 considering your side deck your extra
00:57:58.119 Deck Tech options and even your main
00:57:59.599 deck options so with that being said I
