00:06:44.240 Target the shyon I don't know if how
00:06:46.080 much you want to make your uh I don't

00:06:58.240 pep you're not going to win this are you
00:07:01.199 pep effect attack for
00:07:03.120 game
00:07:06.039 damage it's funny because specifically
00:07:08.520 battle fader and Swift Scarecrow I don't
00:07:10.639 think actually work because I think they
00:07:12.960 kind of affect the monster but damage
00:07:14.479 juggler specifically is uh what your
00:07:16.479 opponent did here okay uh we're going to
00:07:18.560 go main phase two into crw sheep and
00:07:21.440 pass uh okay interesting uh what rank
00:07:25.599 are you out of

00:07:44.080 opponent's drawing now by the way uh
00:07:46.919 kidoh heart I don't think that's going
00:07:48.199 to help you here should have made Ki Kos
00:07:51.360 actually all right battle phase all
00:07:53.560 right we get to do 6,000

00:10:58.240 matter okay anyway uh we're going to
00:11:00.760 orbital here for photon dragon uh
00:11:03.519 tribute at a Galaxy he must be very
00:11:05.320 confused why is my opponent activating
00:11:06.959 card effects by the way if you don't
00:11:08.959 know how timing works it needs to be
00:11:11.320 summoned as chain link one because we
00:11:13.560 activated to summon it as chain link
00:11:14.880 three it misses timing cuz it wasn't the
00:11:16.480 last thing to happen in the LA in the
00:11:17.800 previous chain so uh I don't know maybe
00:11:19.959 we can play through this I mean if
00:11:21.880 there's a deck in the game that can play
00:11:23.040 through this might be it's
00:11:24.839 photons all right uh overlaying into a

00:17:17.400 Calamity and now our opponent can
00:17:19.240 activate cards and effects now remember
00:17:20.839 that we said that this replay is without
00:17:23.640 brickfest okay it's it's snake eye
00:17:26.679 without the brickfest okay so as you can
00:17:30.039 see we're not playing any bricks in this
00:17:31.919 snake eye deck there are no bad cards to
00:17:34.559 draw a dragon Ravine Meeks uh
00:17:38.559 visas um those are all standard cards in
00:17:41.240 snake ey actually so um yeah oh my God
00:17:49.240 El summon Stella
00:17:53.320 pass Oh I thought he had a chance bro I
00:17:56.559 thought he had a
00:17:57.840 chance
00:17:59.840 all right sick that was
00:18:02.440 good uh all right we've got what appears
00:18:05.320 to
00:18:06.440 be a uh Ido pendulum so if you don't
00:18:10.640 know what Ido is this is like basically
00:18:13.000 like a weird kind of um lock that you do
00:18:15.600 to your opponent uh you're supposed to
00:18:17.360 put it to your opponent's side of the
00:18:18.320 field here
00:18:20.799 um you cannot summon
00:18:23.600 monsters so you put this on your
00:18:25.440 opponent's field face up and ideally
00:18:27.679 they don't tribute summon
00:18:29.799 or tribute set because that's the that's
00:18:31.880 the that's actually the out to Ido is
00:18:34.720 that your opponent is unable to uh play
00:18:37.520 because they can't summon monsters so
00:18:39.799 you give it to your opponent and then
00:18:41.120 you probably set up some kind of board
00:18:42.520 that makes it so that they can't crash
00:18:44.840 so the only real way to uh out it is by
00:18:46.799 tribute setting which I think you can
00:18:49.200 out with
00:18:50.679 like whatever the hell this pendulum
00:18:52.679 deck is doing right now cuz that's a
00:18:54.039 light hex sealed Fusion in the hand here
00:18:57.080 uh let him keep uh playing the game I
00:19:00.600 suppose they can't tribute set either
00:19:02.679 because of rulings what is tribute
00:19:04.720 setting considered summoning monsters
00:19:06.240 now oh okay last play here is Verte into
00:19:10.919 okay sanctifier Dragon this is the worst
00:19:14.440 combo ever by the way draw phase
00:19:17.400 sanctifier so you give your opponent Ido
00:19:20.320 and then we get
00:19:22.280 electromite uh sure all right that's it
00:19:25.919 we used our
00:19:27.720 hole
00:19:33.280 we used our whole hand for that by the
00:19:35.679 way card Razer
00:19:38.559 POG all right your opponent is unable to
00:19:40.880 summon though so let's see if uh they
00:19:42.600 can out this somehow don't tell me
00:19:44.280 they're just going to poke with EO for
00:19:45.840 like five turns and win the game your
00:19:48.159 opponent was correct by the way you are
00:19:49.679 a haha loser no
00:19:52.200 offense uh okay we're setting curtain
00:19:54.640 Razer uh we do just die to I don't know
00:19:57.520 actually you didn't need to set Cur
00:19:58.720 Razer they can't summon
00:20:01.080 monsters all right um we need to keep
00:20:04.000 drawing pens monsters to set here which
00:20:06.200 shouldn't be too hard in this

00:27:07.520 cards those are some very fascinating
00:27:10.240 interesting cards we're drawing with
00:27:11.720 this uh deck by the way surely we won't
00:27:14.440 be doing anything unfair and ridiculous
00:27:17.240 with this DNA surgery in our
00:27:19.480 hand Baron def J syron add converter
00:27:24.159 special summon or adding rather Defense
00:27:27.159 Zone
00:27:29.240 H uh I don't know what that is I'm going
00:27:31.360 to read it after we end this turn
00:27:33.840 clearly something silly is about to
00:27:35.840 happen
00:27:37.039 here set pop the Revolution synchron and
00:27:40.440 pass turn all right what are we looking
00:27:41.679 at here for each monster a player
00:27:43.840 controls in the main monster Zone their
00:27:45.279 spell and trap zones in the same column
00:27:47.039 as that monster cannot be destroyed by
00:27:48.519 their opponent's card effects and their
00:27:49.760 opponent cannot Target them with card
00:27:51.320 effects so we're protecting for backrow
00:27:53.919 by having Defense Zone on the field here
00:27:56.279 we're going to go sacred statue bring
00:27:58.640 back Stardust
00:28:00.080 Dragon uh from the graveyard here so if
00:28:03.240 you think about it it's like um
00:28:05.679 lightning storm protection as well as
00:28:07.880 destruction protection of the monsters
00:28:09.399 with the Stardust Dragon that's very
00:28:10.840 clever why is this a [ __ ] mirror
00:28:12.640 match by the
00:28:13.960 way why is this a mirror match okay
00:28:16.159 we're going to add junk synchron here
00:28:18.320 normal summon junk synchron targeting
00:28:20.760 the converter going to we're going to
00:28:23.120 let our opponent do all of this
00:28:25.279 here okay all right uh we're going to
00:28:28.880 make our own junk speeder are we going
00:28:30.279 to negate
00:28:31.840 this okay no cuz we chain blocked it
00:28:34.679 with converter we're going to go Crimson
00:28:37.080 Dragon now tagging out the Stardust
00:28:40.000 spark Dragon tagging itself a buster
00:28:43.640 Dragon wait so what does this do makes
00:28:45.640 everything a dragon
00:28:47.399 monster all right so now everything is a
00:28:50.279 dragon
00:28:53.480 uhhuh right so we can keep
00:28:57.039 sring
00:28:58.600 this is going this is this is going
00:29:00.480 somewhere okay chaining DNA surgery to
00:29:03.399 call
00:29:05.919 spellcaster so now everything is a
00:29:09.480 spellcaster but Buster Dragon also
00:29:11.799 applied to make everything a
00:29:15.240 dragon okay so now we're going to summon
00:29:18.080 Stardust
00:29:20.200 Dragon and we're just going to let the
00:29:22.440 opponent cook here into our own Crimson
00:29:25.679 Dragon Stardust Trail brings back
00:29:27.640 crimson Dragon tagging out here Doppel

00:30:08.880 you could have just negated your and
00:30:10.080 stopped your opponent from playing the
00:30:11.200 game but no we had to let our opponent
00:30:13.720 we had to give them that sliver of hope
00:30:15.440 we had to give them that feeling that
00:30:17.320 they had a chance Fus their entire field
00:30:20.399 away because of the DNA surgery which is
00:30:22.360 into a Quinta magician which is five
00:30:24.200 spellcasters required and then on Fusion
