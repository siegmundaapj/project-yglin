00:00:00.199 use my affiliate link to support the
00:00:02.080 channel down in the description hey
00:00:04.400 what's up guys we are Genesis gaming and
00:00:06.440 we have returning guest Steve a lot of
00:00:08.400 people really loved your last pendulum
00:00:10.360 uh deck profile and your combo videos so
00:00:13.200 we're here to give you an update post
00:00:15.120 Legacy of Destruction and uh what do you
00:00:17.560 have for us today um I basically got uh
00:00:20.439 you know pendulum I I guess you can call
00:00:22.279 a draco Slayer pendulum um performal pal
00:00:25.599 it's it's just an assortment pendulum
00:00:27.560 pile is the way I kind of describe it no
00:00:30.679 you know not the magician build that I
00:00:32.479 know a lot of you guys seen before but I
00:00:34.440 do think that this is the best way to
00:00:35.920 play this deck now um so uh you know
00:00:39.280 it's very fun to play uh there's so many
00:00:42.000 options so many different things you
00:00:43.200 could do we lost a couple cards with
00:00:44.600 Baron we lost uh Baron and Savage um but
00:00:48.280 there's other ways to make up for it
00:00:49.680 this deck still has some powerful plays
00:00:51.559 unfortunately the pendulum mechanic is
00:00:53.160 still a little bit restricted but
00:00:54.879 they're making up for it by you know
00:00:56.559 printing so many great cards like this
00:00:58.160 one here that just came out in like re
00:01:00.280 destruction so uh yeah I would
00:01:03.039 definitely recommend if you guys liked
00:01:04.400 the older profiles give this one a try I
00:01:06.840 guarantee you'll like it I I have a deep
00:01:08.680 passion for pendulum so you know yeah I
00:01:11.240 think it's I've almost perfected the
00:01:12.759 style of the deck so we'll get right
00:01:14.320 into it awesome 40 card M absolutely the
00:01:17.040 first of the new cards is a legacy of
00:01:19.479 Destruction card pendulum witch what
00:01:22.000 this card does on normal or pendulum
00:01:24.560 summon you can Target a card in your
00:01:26.040 pendulum Zone destroy it and this card
00:01:28.400 and you can add a level four uh pendulum
00:01:30.799 level four lower pendulum from deck to
00:01:32.399 hand so this is really good for
00:01:34.119 triggering cards
00:01:35.759 like um the one Draco Slayer card here
00:01:39.079 which would be ignis yeah um because if
00:01:41.399 this is in the scale or on the field and
00:01:42.880 you pop it you could summon a draco
00:01:44.159 Slayer from deck so these two combo
00:01:45.680 really well um and then this card gets
00:01:48.000 you into a really busted card which is
00:01:50.040 Waki um so you don't have to play the
00:01:52.240 bike to search this card because I think
00:01:54.360 that card just inevitably ends up
00:01:55.719 breaking you in The Grind game um so you
00:01:57.960 don't really have to worry about it but
00:02:00.079 yeah this searches for this and it
00:02:01.479 doesn't put any spells in your graveyard
00:02:03.360 so um yeah I think it's really worth
00:02:05.920 playing this over uh the bike but you
00:02:08.360 can also play the bike if you want cuz
00:02:09.800 you could do stuff with Excel you can
00:02:11.080 make thiser so it's also pretty good but
00:02:13.680 uh I think this is a little more
00:02:15.040 tailored towards the style of the deck
00:02:17.040 so three of that because you want to
00:02:18.440 open it and then as I said we got three
00:02:21.120 of the super heavy Samurai
00:02:23.000 Waki I don't do the crazy stuff I don't
00:02:25.360 search any of the souls I just use this
00:02:27.120 as a free level four tuner extender
00:02:29.319 because this up the Draco Slayer plays
00:02:31.120 with any of your normal summons and it's
00:02:33.040 just so free set your scale up when you
00:02:34.760 Synchro Summon with it and then uh yeah
00:02:37.080 you just got the uh the one bend that
00:02:38.599 goes with it card bricks don't don't use
00:02:41.760 this this being a brick as an excuse to
00:02:43.480 put it up to two because you're either
00:02:45.920 going to see it or you don't and you
00:02:47.440 don't want to increase your chances of
00:02:48.840 seeing it so you can resolve it cuz then
00:02:50.760 you're going to see it more that's my
00:02:52.480 logic um if you see it it sucks but
00:02:54.720 there is a great way to spin this card
00:02:56.840 back say you open this card and you get
00:02:59.080 access to waku USI you can always make
00:03:01.440 this guy destroy a card spin this guy
00:03:03.920 back into the deck then you're able to
00:03:05.360 resolve Waki so there are plenty of ways
00:03:08.080 to deal with it um so yeah this is just
00:03:10.799 really good you could play again the
00:03:12.599 extra super heavy Samurai stuff but this
00:03:14.400 is basically just a build tailored
00:03:16.080 towards the best pendulum cards to
00:03:18.159 create the best end board and keep
00:03:20.519 Advantage
00:03:21.599 going um next obligatory got the Chon
00:03:24.920 the astrograph sorcerer um if a card you
00:03:28.239 control is destroyed by battle or c
00:03:30.480 you summon it from hand and then you can
00:03:32.080 add a copy of the destroyed card um or
00:03:34.760 any card that was destroyed that turn as
00:03:36.720 long as it resides in the place that it
00:03:38.519 was when it was destroyed so if it was
00:03:40.560 destroyed and sent to the extra deck and
00:03:43.000 then you pendulum summoned it and then
00:03:44.319 it went back to the extra deck you could
00:03:46.080 not search that but if it stayed there
00:03:47.840 when it was destroyed and sent there you
00:03:49.200 can get any card that was destroyed so
00:03:50.959 really really good nice CR here such a
00:03:53.319 broken nice looking card and you love
00:03:55.640 destroying card so you could trigger
00:03:57.040 this multiple times you could Loop it
00:03:58.680 with uh the new exceed here it's just so
00:04:01.959 good um and then to complement that we
00:04:04.680 have three Chrono if Astro didn't I mean
00:04:07.760 if Astro didn't exist this guy would be
00:04:09.480 the next best uh extender you know when
00:04:11.959 you're destroying cards cuz he summons
00:04:13.680 himself from hand and another monster
00:04:16.440 and so it basically if you have this and
00:04:19.199 like the pendulum witch as we were
00:04:20.880 explaining earlier this combos really
00:04:22.919 well with this card too cuz even if you
00:04:24.800 don't have something good to destroy you
00:04:26.600 destroy this destroy your scale get a
00:04:28.960 search of waku II then you could summon
00:04:30.919 this guy out from hand and another
00:04:32.560 monster and keep going before you even
00:04:34.520 make Beyond before you even pendulum
00:04:36.759 summon cuz that's the goal you want to
00:04:38.560 do as much as you can before you
00:04:40.120 pendulum summon because your pendulum
00:04:41.840 summon everyone knows is is where your
00:04:44.800 strongest plays are coming from so bait
00:04:46.960 out is force them to use as much as they
00:04:49.080 can uh and then also in the scale it's
00:04:51.280 an extender we do play the
00:04:53.639 um we do play the uh the time start to
00:04:57.960 go with it CU you put this in the scale
00:05:00.520 and then you could summon this guy from
00:05:01.759 the deck so even if you don't have any
00:05:03.240 way to destroy him and summon him from
00:05:04.759 hand you just put him in scale and get
00:05:06.600 this guy from the deck and then that's
00:05:08.039 your free Beyond before you Pendle him
00:05:09.560 summon so again he's a dual purpose card
00:05:12.600 I really think you honestly have to play
00:05:14.199 it yeah um so we'll go on to the next
00:05:18.360 engine um we play the one of Revolution
00:05:21.319 we don't use his hand effect uh but his
00:05:23.400 hand effect is you can discard it pay
00:05:25.880 500 and add any level later lower
00:05:27.639 pendulum dragon from deck to hand you
00:05:29.000 can search dark worm it's a really good
00:05:30.759 card but we use it for its scale effect
00:05:33.240 so it scale effect says you could Target
00:05:35.919 one
00:05:37.440 um you can Target one Dragon Fusion sink
00:05:40.400 or or exas in your graveyard destroy
00:05:42.520 this card and if you do you summon that
00:05:44.160 back so as long as it was properly
00:05:45.400 summoned so you basically use this card
00:05:47.840 in combination with ignis cuz this is a
00:05:50.400 soft once per turn so you just keep
00:05:52.400 looping this guy summoning him back from
00:05:54.080 grave and summoning more Draco Slayers
00:05:56.240 so that's pretty much what this guy is
00:05:57.960 for and it also combos
00:06:00.560 um with this card so basically the setup
00:06:04.520 is this guy will be in your scale you uh
00:06:07.280 that guy s Synchro is in your grave this
00:06:09.360 is on your field you go to destroy this
00:06:11.440 if your pendulum card would be destroyed
00:06:12.960 you use this guy to foolish burial um a
00:06:16.479 spellcaster instead so you'd be able to
00:06:18.039 send cards like this or a card that I'll
00:06:19.759 show you later um so yeah we'll get into
00:06:22.400 that a little more but yeah this just
00:06:24.360 one that's all you need so you can add
00:06:26.240 it back to your hand again um with the
00:06:29.319 new exceed right here uh so yeah I I
00:06:33.000 really think you only need one um so one
00:06:35.400 of that and then the next is uh one
00:06:38.360 performal pal OD eyes dissolver um it's
00:06:41.639 basically how you make your Vortex
00:06:43.360 Dragon um if you summon this guy to the
00:06:45.880 field you could fuse uh and you could
00:06:47.800 use one of your scales so you use that
00:06:49.520 guy to make Vortex dragon or in the
00:06:51.720 scale he's just a poly too but um and he
00:06:55.039 also does have another relevant effect
00:06:56.840 at the start of the damage step if your
00:06:58.199 pendulum battles you could spec him from
00:06:59.840 hand you take no damage and then your
00:07:01.479 monster can't be destroyed by battle so
00:07:02.879 he does summon himself cuz he is a scale
00:07:05.280 or a level eight so you can't really
00:07:07.000 naturally pendulum summon him in this
00:07:08.520 deck but it's still worth playing yeah
00:07:10.759 um and then you got a couple more one
00:07:13.240 ofs one monkey board one lady an
00:07:15.680 basically the combo with these guys is
00:07:17.319 you pendulum summon out this another way
00:07:19.800 to destroy cards you destroy two cards
00:07:21.879 search for this and this then you scale
00:07:24.599 this search for this and then you can
00:07:26.240 discard these two and draw two cards so
00:07:29.199 um those those three are good one ofs I
00:07:31.599 would probably play monkey board at more
00:07:33.400 because it's nice sometimes to just
00:07:34.759 normal summon Joker get monkey board get
00:07:37.120 your other scale for free without having
00:07:38.759 to invest Two Cards into your pendulum
00:07:40.759 scales um so yeah and then lady an as I
00:07:43.720 just said you can discard it in a
00:07:44.840 performal p to draw two cards and
00:07:46.479 everyone should know what Mony board
00:07:47.680 does so yeah three really good one ofs
00:07:49.879 definitely play them and then uh the uh
00:07:53.479 one of the best normal summons in the
00:07:54.720 deck aside from which is Joker Joker
00:07:56.720 searches for this um it searches for
00:07:59.599 harmonizing magician uh and that's
00:08:02.000 pretty much all you really need in life
00:08:03.800 uh these two are the best things to
00:08:05.080 pendulum summon in your deck so any way
00:08:07.199 to get to them off of your normal summon
00:08:09.560 uh is really good um so yeah three of
00:08:11.960 this card you have six normal summons in
00:08:13.440 the deck pretty much that you get insane
00:08:15.319 cards off of so you're going to get
00:08:16.960 there before you pendulum summon
00:08:18.919 hopefully um and then excuse the
00:08:20.720 Rarities but then we got three of this
00:08:22.280 guy really good for as I just said
00:08:24.800 popping two cards and searching two
00:08:26.319 different name performal Pals to get
00:08:27.680 your Fusion play going get your draw two
00:08:29.840 going um and then um yeah so three of
00:08:34.599 this guy you definitely want to open it
00:08:35.919 destroying your cards is really good a
00:08:37.640 again you destroy the ignis you know you
00:08:39.519 destroy um this guy in the scale summon
00:08:41.479 from deck do you just want to open him
00:08:43.839 is that why it's at three or is it more
00:08:45.279 of a Grind game thing um well it's also
00:08:47.560 at three as well too because believe it
00:08:49.160 or not this deck now kind of struggles a
00:08:50.839 little bit to have low scales where it
00:08:52.320 was the other way around before yeah so
00:08:54.440 it's a really good two scale again I
00:08:57.040 think it's worth playing this deck is
00:09:00.000 kind of tailor made to like obviously
00:09:03.040 you want to go first um if you go first
00:09:06.240 uninterrupted you could pretty much win
00:09:07.920 the game so consistency wise as long as
00:09:10.800 you have scales you can turn any of your
00:09:13.279 monsters into any of your monsters
00:09:15.120 basically you know so I mean if you open
00:09:18.000 multiple of this card it's honestly fine
00:09:19.760 you just put it in the scale and then
00:09:21.040 you can just keep all you need is to
00:09:22.560 pendelum summon one and you just need
00:09:24.399 the monsters to be level four as well so
00:09:27.480 um and then for The Magicians um we play
00:09:31.200 two harmonizing one time gazer and two
00:09:33.839 Celestial this summons either of these
00:09:35.880 from the deck so free rank fours free
00:09:37.760 Synchro eights you can even make Synchro
00:09:39.720 sevens with this card wow um still the
00:09:42.160 best thing to pendulum summon for
00:09:43.360 magicians in this card um if it was
00:09:45.519 normal or special summon this turn um
00:09:47.839 you can activate the effect based on the
00:09:49.440 other monsters you control if you
00:09:50.760 control a different pendulum you can add
00:09:52.800 a pendulum during the end phase if you
00:09:54.880 control a Synchro monster they can't
00:09:56.839 activate your opponent can't activate
00:09:58.560 monster effects the rest of the turn so
00:10:00.200 there is ways to get this out get this
00:10:02.399 on the field and then do that before you
00:10:04.000 even pen or before you even summon five
00:10:06.120 times um so that's really good and this
00:10:08.720 is also a performal pale and a magician
00:10:10.760 which comes up for a monkey board cuz it
00:10:12.800 needs a performal pil in the scale yeah
00:10:15.000 so but that's all you need for The
00:10:16.120 Magicians I don't think you really need
00:10:17.800 anymore and then we'll get into kind of
00:10:19.880 the bread and butter of the deck now got
00:10:22.680 triple ignis the Draco Slayer ignis
00:10:25.120 Phoenix this is basically a plush fire
00:10:27.519 for Draco Slayers um if it's destroyed
00:10:29.880 by battle or card Effect you can summon
00:10:31.399 a draco Slayer from your deck and you
00:10:33.000 can make it a Tuner monster um so this
00:10:35.440 is really good so you don't have to play
00:10:36.800 luster anymore cuz he can only Synchro
00:10:38.639 into his own stuff or exce into his own
00:10:40.920 stuff um so yeah and this is again it
00:10:44.120 combos with so many cards in this deck
00:10:47.160 um it combos with the sorcerer um you
00:10:50.560 know it combos with uh you know the
00:10:52.600 astrograph sorcerer when you destroy it
00:10:55.000 combos with the pendulum which so
00:10:57.120 opening this card with any of these
00:10:58.680 cards really is just insane half the
00:11:00.560 time um so yeah three of this you want
00:11:03.040 to maximize it scale seven you only have
00:11:05.560 level fours and a level six that you
00:11:07.639 really care to pendulum summon
00:11:08.920 consistently so seven is a perfect scale
00:11:11.200 as well too plenty of high scales um and
00:11:14.000 if you do decide to play a little bit
00:11:15.720 different style of the deck his scale
00:11:18.040 effect is good too cuz during the main
00:11:19.480 phase you could shuffle a face up
00:11:20.760 pendulum monster from your extra deck
00:11:22.160 into the deck and then you can add a
00:11:23.680 non- pendulum Draco Slayer ignite so
00:11:26.200 that's really good for searching those
00:11:27.399 archetype of Boss monsters but I do not
00:11:29.560 play those
00:11:30.839 so and then the other one that's really
00:11:33.440 good is Majesty
00:11:35.040 Pegasus um if you have this as well
00:11:38.000 combo this also combos really well with
00:11:39.839 this because you could Target another
00:11:41.279 Draco Slayer Magis Spectre in your Zone
00:11:43.399 with this card add a different name than
00:11:46.200 the other Zone that you targeted and
00:11:47.800 then you can destroy a card on the field
00:11:50.399 so if you have these in your scale um
00:11:53.040 you basically would use this effect
00:11:55.120 targeting this search for this pop this
00:11:57.880 and then use this guy's effect again to
00:12:00.720 summon this from the deck and then that
00:12:02.200 gets you your field spell so definitely
00:12:04.440 three of majesty Pegasus for that exact
00:12:07.040 reason um and then three of this guy a
00:12:09.760 little less important but still a good
00:12:11.120 extender you could just Target another
00:12:13.040 one of your Draco Slayers in the scale
00:12:14.839 and then just special summon it again
00:12:16.839 any way to let you go into Beyond before
00:12:18.839 you pendulum summon is pretty much the
00:12:20.440 goal here um so that's that and then
00:12:23.240 when you tribute it because there is a
00:12:25.160 way to Tribute it to summon this guy who
00:12:26.800 tribute it in another pendulum you can
00:12:28.240 add a draco Slayer from extra deck to
00:12:30.000 hand so that's really
00:12:32.560 good um y three of this
00:12:35.680 guy and
00:12:37.480 then we play three curtain Razer uh it's
00:12:41.199 still a level four extender in the deck
00:12:43.480 as I just said you want to make Beyond
00:12:45.279 before you pendulum summon and just
00:12:47.279 letting you guys know if they Ash or
00:12:49.320 impermanence
00:12:50.519 Beyond um you can still use monster
00:12:53.320 effects and stuff so if they do this you
00:12:54.880 go this you get any of your extenders go
00:12:56.760 into this and they you know they
00:12:58.760 interrupt it and then you have a normal
00:13:00.639 summon normal summon something else make
00:13:02.279 another one and just do it again so
00:13:04.760 awesome and then the last monster is
00:13:07.399 Magic Spectre unicorn Kieran cards
00:13:09.160 finally back there's plenty of ways for
00:13:11.079 you to get access again Beyond searches
00:13:12.839 this card you can keep summoning it from
00:13:14.279 your graveyard with this summon it from
00:13:15.760 your hand off your end phas searches
00:13:17.279 with
00:13:18.360 Celestial it's so easy to get to one is
00:13:20.760 honestly fine uh it's a low scale as
00:13:22.800 well too if you ever are lacking on
00:13:24.480 those as I just said so but yeah that's
00:13:27.079 it for the monsters and the only spell
00:13:28.519 card that we Play A Sky Iris the only
00:13:30.519 reason we play this is because um it
00:13:33.279 searches for your odd eyes monsters by
00:13:36.480 destroying a face up card you control
00:13:38.079 you could search for this or you could
00:13:39.360 search for this um but again the most
00:13:42.240 important part of that is that it
00:13:43.440 destroys a face up card you control so
00:13:45.680 again we love destroying cards so that's
00:13:48.480 the goal and a searchable way to destroy
00:13:50.320 cards is really good and then that
00:13:52.160 searches for a monster reborn or
00:13:53.920 searches for a Vortex Dragon pretty much
00:13:56.720 so really important to play that card
00:13:58.759 and that card is searched off of majesty
00:14:01.040 Pegasus cuz when it's pendulum summoned
00:14:03.199 or summoned off the effect of a draco
00:14:04.800 Slayer you add a field spell from deck
00:14:06.440 to hand and then you discard a card so
00:14:08.680 really good one little combo that you
00:14:10.720 could do with that basically is when you
00:14:12.959 pendulum summon both of these you
00:14:14.759 resolve this is chain link one this is
00:14:16.519 chain link two so you pop a card get the
00:14:19.120 search for this guy get the search of
00:14:21.160 this for this and then you use this as
00:14:22.440 your discard to get that in the grave to
00:14:24.120 summon it back with Seline or something
00:14:25.720 like that and that's your Fusion play
00:14:27.800 that's pretty much the main deck 4 cards
00:14:30.279 uh you notice no hand traps no generic
00:14:32.279 cards or anything like that you either
00:14:34.959 are going to win with what you have or
00:14:36.839 not um the deck has no problem going
00:14:39.480 second if you have a really good hand
00:14:41.519 and a way to bait through stuff no deck
00:14:43.120 can play through five six negates I
00:14:44.639 don't care what it is you know so you
00:14:46.880 know it's a really fun deck to play
00:14:48.480 Don't Let It discourage you that you
00:14:49.720 don't see Triple tack or Ash or anything
00:14:51.639 like that you really don't need the
00:14:52.800 cards all you need is your scales and
00:14:54.759 spam five every turn so but we'll go on
00:14:58.320 to the extra deck now 40 cards in the
00:15:00.000 main uh we play to exceed the pendulum
00:15:02.519 this is a new card from age of Overlord
00:15:05.120 um it takes two plus effect monsters
00:15:07.279 including a pendulum and on link summon
00:15:09.600 you can add a pendulum monster from your
00:15:11.480 face up extra deck to your hand you
00:15:13.120 could abuse cards like this multiple
00:15:15.040 times and again you could abuse
00:15:16.959 astrograph multiple times and then its
00:15:19.639 other effect is during the main phase
00:15:21.519 quick effect you can special summon a
00:15:23.959 pendulum from hander grave with a level
00:15:25.759 in between your current scales so really
00:15:27.959 good for The Grind game getting back
00:15:29.360 your pendulums from grave there's a part
00:15:31.800 in your combo where you have a 12 scale
00:15:34.519 and then you have a Big Ben in your
00:15:36.600 scale as well who just so happens to be
00:15:38.720 a level one so when you have that
00:15:41.240 there's Parts in the combo where this
00:15:42.560 guy will be in your grave who's a level
00:15:43.920 eight and then you could use her effect
00:15:45.759 cuz your scales are from 1 to 12 to
00:15:47.440 summon this guy from the graveyard so
00:15:49.480 that's really cool again the more you
00:15:51.199 play this deck the more you realize how
00:15:52.639 much you can do um so two of this card
00:15:55.639 because uh again it's just so good you
00:15:57.600 just the arrows are perfect The Grind
00:15:59.480 game helps really well with this card
00:16:00.920 even if you can't pendal him summon you
00:16:02.680 make this and just revive something from
00:16:04.120 grave it's a free appoa so really good
00:16:06.639 link three it's really what the deck
00:16:08.240 needed and then as well you play two
00:16:10.399 Beyond this is your link two on link
00:16:13.079 summon you pay 1,200 while it's in the
00:16:14.959 extra monster Zone to add a pendulum
00:16:16.600 monster from deck to hand but the next
00:16:18.800 thing you have to do is pendulum summon
00:16:20.880 or your scales are negated and you can't
00:16:22.480 activate monster effects but that's
00:16:23.880 completely fine searching for any
00:16:25.800 pendulum is just absolutely insane the
00:16:27.480 scales are good and if if you pendulum
00:16:29.440 summon two different levels to her zones
00:16:31.120 you can destroy two cards on the field
00:16:32.560 so going second it's even better so you
00:16:36.079 think two is mandatory two is absolutely
00:16:38.160 mandatory exceed um you may be able to
00:16:41.040 get away with one of this card cuz you
00:16:42.440 do have access to Seline but I think two
00:16:44.759 of this is absolutely mandatory 100% um
00:16:48.360 with all the extenders that you have in
00:16:49.759 your deck even if you get a couple cards
00:16:52.000 taken away from your first turn field
00:16:53.720 being able to make that again to get
00:16:55.120 another card to pendulum summon or fix
00:16:56.680 your scales is really good um and then
00:16:58.920 your only link four uh is appalossa this
00:17:01.480 ends the combo again we have cards to
00:17:03.600 get free link fours which is our link
00:17:05.319 3es so you might as well abuse this and
00:17:07.640 uh they either have to waste their
00:17:09.000 battle phase to get over it or play
00:17:10.359 through two negates at least sometimes
00:17:12.400 even more you can even make this with
00:17:13.679 four negates with busted hands so appos
00:17:16.280 is really good we lost a lot of negate
00:17:17.959 so it's still a negate that we have
00:17:19.720 access to um and then one Seline this is
00:17:23.199 still good you still have to play it it
00:17:24.679 pretty much serves the Ser safe purpose
00:17:26.400 as this card minus to add back from
00:17:28.079 extra Deck but it's just really good you
00:17:30.200 can even abuse both of these in one turn
00:17:31.919 to get the double revive from grave so
00:17:34.039 yeah I think you just still have to play
00:17:35.360 it you just like the option to be able
00:17:36.960 to go into both yes absolutely and then
00:17:39.400 obligatory these cards are just nuts uh
00:17:42.600 there's no explanation needed here um
00:17:45.919 and then we got Vortex Dragon sorry for
00:17:48.160 the Rarity this is our Omni negate that
00:17:49.799 we make with the dissolver as I was
00:17:51.280 explaining earlier so it's free and by
00:17:53.679 the way if it's properly summoned so you
00:17:55.520 can even revive it from the graveyard
00:17:57.559 with cards like Revolution Dragon too if
00:17:59.520 they destroy it so that's really good
00:18:01.720 cuz again he revives Dragon Fusion syn
00:18:03.559 or rexes so really good and then on
00:18:05.840 summon he could bounce a face up attack
00:18:07.919 position monster your opponent controls
00:18:09.400 really good for playing around things
00:18:10.720 that float uh mirror Jade etc
00:18:14.159 etc um one of this guy you could tribute
00:18:17.480 a draco Slayer and a pendulum to uh
00:18:19.600 special summon him from the extra deck
00:18:21.000 so that synergized with that Draco
00:18:22.720 Dynamite guy told you about that's how
00:18:24.280 you tribute him and then he summons a
00:18:26.200 draco Slayer from hander grave really
00:18:27.760 good extension just play it's it's how
00:18:29.919 the Draco Slayer engine kind of Loops
00:18:31.600 free advantage and then one xas um
00:18:34.559 Majesty paladin on EX summon during the
00:18:37.000 end phase you can add a a pendulum so
00:18:39.400 that's a way to add the Kier into your
00:18:40.720 hand to summon with the exceed the
00:18:42.240 pendulum you can add Astro chronograph
00:18:45.320 really really good and then you can
00:18:46.840 detach to summon a draco Slayer from
00:18:48.480 your face up extra deck so you have to
00:18:50.200 summon it to his own but again really
00:18:52.320 good this is the other exceed that you
00:18:53.880 have during the combo and then you make
00:18:55.440 time star time star takes two magicians
00:18:58.200 so you make a with harmonizing and
00:18:59.600 Celestial magician detached to search
00:19:01.960 any dark spellcaster search as Astro
00:19:04.039 search as chronograph search as Joker
00:19:05.760 Etc really really good and then if a
00:19:08.440 card you control be destroyed by battle
00:19:10.000 or card Effect pendulum wise you can
00:19:11.960 foolish a spellcaster instead so you get
00:19:13.919 dissolver in the grave Kieran in the
00:19:15.360 grave and again summon him back with the
00:19:17.039 seed you so you guys should see where
00:19:18.679 this is going these will be both be on
00:19:20.760 your field so after you're done with
00:19:22.480 your combo you slap this guy down and
00:19:24.640 then you slap that guy down um really
00:19:27.480 good again I wanted another negate in
00:19:29.320 here you could also play Infinity and
00:19:31.080 stuff but I think this requires one less
00:19:33.000 extra deck spot and then protection with
00:19:35.280 a negate I think is a little better than
00:19:37.280 a pure Omni negate in my opinion so I
00:19:39.400 elected to go with this guy and again if
00:19:41.679 people some decks really can't out this
00:19:43.360 card it might auto win so yeah we play
00:19:45.559 it 100% um and then the last card is uh
00:19:49.360 one Synchro um igna prominence um once
00:19:53.400 per turn you could Target a pendulum
00:19:54.799 card on the field or in the pendulum
00:19:56.799 zone so even in the mirror match you
00:19:58.840 your opponent's cards and then you can
00:20:00.400 non Shu non-target shuffle a card on the
00:20:02.280 field into the deck again you can really
00:20:04.480 you could put your Big Ben in the deck
00:20:05.799 if you draw to use your Waki you could
00:20:07.720 put so much stuff back but the most
00:20:09.840 important effect is soft once per turn
00:20:12.720 you can summon a draco Slayer from your
00:20:14.240 deck and defense position so and that's
00:20:16.880 again you abuse that with the revolution
00:20:19.200 Dragon um you know you get the
00:20:22.520 uh you get the revolution dragon off the
00:20:25.080 sky Iris that you got from the Majesty
00:20:27.080 Pegasus and he gets you Majesty Pegasus
00:20:29.679 so that he gets you this which gets you
00:20:31.559 this which gets you this it's it's it's
00:20:33.720 so good um it's it's it's why you play
00:20:36.440 it and with um you know with the double
00:20:40.440 search you just or with the double spec
00:20:41.960 from deck that you abuse it twice you
00:20:43.840 really just get so much free link
00:20:45.880 material um so yeah you don't need to
00:20:47.960 play anymore I would play Savage and
00:20:49.400 baron but
00:20:50.760 unfortunately this is the last Synchro
00:20:52.760 remaining in the deck so I really
00:20:55.320 implore you guys to try this deck out I
00:20:57.440 know a lot of you like the magician this
00:20:59.120 plays very similarly um to the deck as
00:21:02.679 far as what it can do so I think you
00:21:05.760 guys should give it a try and uh let me
00:21:07.360 know in the comments what you think
00:21:09.080 about it and I'd be glad to answer any
