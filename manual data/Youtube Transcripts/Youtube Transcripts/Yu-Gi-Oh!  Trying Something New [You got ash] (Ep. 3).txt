00:04:26.639 calculator don't worry
00:04:30.000 I don't
00:04:37.280 know think
00:04:44.910 [Music]
00:04:59.800 where's your
00:05:06.840 target really trying to figure out how
00:05:09.080 lost misses Tom
00:05:11.960 it's so if he's something anything right
00:05:14.440 here it'll
00:05:16.520 Miss Nice you had
00:05:19.400 more activate
00:05:22.720 Prosperity was like I I make it I make
00:05:25.520 it I don't give a [ __ ] no yeah what is
00:05:27.800 he what he going to do not play Fusion
00:05:30.039 uh chain links will be I I need bodyless
00:05:34.199 I need
00:05:40.319 body I'm turn player I have triggers
00:05:43.280 over yours but you can't activate
00:05:45.600 anything your window is uh Hey Clifton
00:05:48.960 explain this interaction with with the
00:05:51.039 with the loss cuz I'm turn player so the
00:05:53.199 fusion is not the the last thing that
00:05:55.280 happens yeah so since he chained Brandon
00:05:57.160 and red this was summon as chain link to
00:05:59.080 so lost is a win effect so it misses its
00:06:01.720 timing to give it the protect that's why
00:06:03.960 all Fusion summons have to be chain one
00:06:05.400 order for loss you'll still get the
00:06:07.039 search because the search is but I can
00:06:08.759 still respond but you can still so chain
00:06:10.440 link one and
00:06:12.680 then where's your
00:06:21.360 [Music]
00:06:23.639 targets

00:06:49.919 you wait hold on do I yeah yeah you're
00:06:53.599 good
00:06:55.759 so you get negated
00:07:00.039 It Whatever on my f gets oh so iate it
00:07:02.680 and then you resolve your
00:07:05.960 summons no that gets first yeah yeah you
00:07:09.120 still you you still got to resolve this
00:07:11.360 I know like after oh I negate these two
00:07:14.160 and then you special
00:07:18.919 special and then you said did you
00:07:20.840 trigger this too yeah then you resolve
00:07:23.639 that why not send a [ __ ] spell God
